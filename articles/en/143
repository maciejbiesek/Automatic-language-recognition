== Biography ==

=== Education ===
Born in Teaneck, New Jersey, Heatley graduated from Teaneck High School in 1993. He graduated from the San Francisco Art Institute in 2000.

=== Comics ===
Though he studied painting and filmmaking at Oberlin College, Heatley started drawing comics regularly in the late 1990s. Since then, his comics and illustrations have appeared on the cover of The New Yorker, in The New York Times, McSweeneys, Mome, and Kramers Ergot, among others. He has been featured three times in the Best American Comics series. Fantagraphics has published two issues of his solo comic book series, Deadpan, and Pantheon Books released his first full-length book, My Brain is Hanging Upside Down, in September 2008.

=== Music ===
Heatley's high school band Velvet Cactus Society released two albums on Shimmy Disc in the early 1990s. In 2008 he recorded (under his own name) a soundtrack to his graphic novel "My Brain is Hanging Upside Down" featuring a cover of The Ramones song by the same name. The soundtrack was released on WonderSound records.

=== Personal life ===
David Heatley played the baby Jesus at a Christmas pageant in 1974, months after he was born. A few years later, his family moved to teaneck, NJ, where they became disenchanted with Catholicism and joined an episcopal church which might have had the worst liturgical music in the country. Heatley was confirmed at age 13 and stopped going to church the following year. After a decade and a half of self-destructive behavior, he had a spiritual awakening while visiting California in 2001-about which, more later. Heatley now lives in Jackson heights, NY, with his wife Rebecca Gopoian (an agnostic, Jewish-Armenian poet), and their two children.

== Inspiration ==
Heatley lists among his influences Daniel Clowes, Gary Panter, Fort Thunder, and Paper Rad.
