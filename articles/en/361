Utility-Business Intelligence (UBI) is an extension of the term Business Intelligence. The public utility industry in the United States is governed by specific sets of regulations which leads to a drastically enhanced set of reporting and analysis requirements. The additional requirements far exceed those addressed by traditional BI technologies. These needs include an additional ledger of accounts, known as FERC Accounts, special treatment of inventory, the tying of regulated and GAAP accounting, the rapid development of specific reports for rate cases, and other regulatory characteristics that make utility industry analysis unique.
The utility industry's additional reporting and accounting requirements make traditional BI technologies insufficient to meet the needs of regulated utilities. Utility-Business Intelligence represents an enhanced set of analysis and reporting technologies which meet these specific needs.
