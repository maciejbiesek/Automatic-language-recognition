Fenouilldes (Occitan: Fenolheds/Fenolheda, Catalan: Fenolleds/Fenolleda), is a French comarca and a traditional Occitan-speaking area in the dpartement of Pyrnes-Orientales. The capital of the comarca is Saint-Paul-de-Fenouillet (Sant Pau de Fenolhet).

Fenouilldes has been part of France since the Treaty of Corbeil of 1258. In 1790, during the French Revolution, it was incorporated in a newly created dpartement along with the Roussillon comarques.
