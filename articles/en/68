== History ==
Jacques Glnat started his comics fanzine Schtroumpf (the French, original, title of The Smurfs) in 1969, when he was still a student. In 1972, only twenty years old, he established his own publishing house, Glnat. The first two books were by Claude Serre and by Claire Bretcher. Two years later, he already received the award for best publisher at the Angoulme International Comics Festival. To support the rapid growth, the company opened warehouses in Orly near Paris, and a flagship store in Paris.
A new comics magazine, Circus, first appeared in 1975 and existed until 1989. But the next few years saw Glnat move more away from the traditional juvenile Franco-Belgian comics and more towards the graphic novel, with an emphasis on their successful historical series by Franois Bourgeon and Andr Juillard. A second magazine, Vcu, dedicated to historical comics, was created in 1985 and survived until 2004.
From 1980 on, Glnat also published non-fiction books related to mountain climbing and to the sea. They also bought the publisher Vents d'Ouest and from 1991 on started publishing manga. But the biggest success of all came with Titeuf by Zep, which soon was one of the bestselling French comic series, with its own magazine Tch and animated series.
On 5 October 2011, yielded 100% of the capital of Glnat Espaa to Joan Navarro and Flix Sabat, the two heads of the former subsidiary.

The company has two international subsidiaries, Glnat Benelux and Glnat Suisse (Switzerland). The company is also very active in Canada and collaborates with other publishers in other countries.

Glnat Benelux has 13% of the market of Belgian comic shops.

=== Head office ===

The company head office is in central Grenoble, in the former Convent of St. Cecilia, a 17th-century building which previously hosted a theater. Jacques Glnat had the building restored so it could become the headquarters of the company. The building's restoration took five years to complete. 100 employees work in the building. The building's archives, library, and private collection are open to the public.
