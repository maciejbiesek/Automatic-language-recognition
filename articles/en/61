Living Lohan is an American reality television series that debuted on E! on May 26, 2008. The series aired for a total of nine episodes, ending its run on July 27, 2008.

== Synopsis ==
The program documents the daily lives of actress/singer Lindsay Lohan's family, with most of the focus on manager/mother Dina and younger sister Ali's attempt to break into show business. Also appearing are brother Dakota "Cody" Lohan, grandmother Ann "Nana" Sullivan, who is Dina's mother and a former radio actress, and Jeremy Greene, a music producer helping Ali with her debut album. Lindsay Lohan did not participate in the series.
According to Dina Lohan, the series did not air a second season because producers "wanted us to do these crazy things, like my son cheating on his girlfriend, me faking a pregnancy. I was like, 'No, no, no! They had ideas that weren't conducive to our ideas."

== Critical reception ==
Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly graded the show F and commented, "The irritation turned to repulsion around the first minute ... Dina snipes about the paparazzi's invasion of privacy, but thanks to her, there's not much left to invade." 
Troy Patterson of Slate magazine said, "The show is crisply edited and tangily ironic without pushing its points too hard .... Living Lohan is not just a symptom of cultural decay but an active agent of it, commodifying the very youth and soul of Ali Lohanyounger sister of poor little Lindsay ... Living Lohan' is one big exploitative mess." 
Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald graded the show D and said, "Living Lohan scrapes the bottom of the stupidity barrel." 
Brian Lowry of Variety said, "It's a tedious exercise, joining E!'s Keeping Up with the Kardashians in the realm of mother-daughter bonding experiences, with limited appeal beyond, perhaps appropriately, those pesky tabloids for which the featured "talent" profess disdain ... The show at times provides unintended comedy, representing E!'s best hope of transforming Living Lohan into a guilty pleasure, if not for the reasons Dina (who doubles as a producer) would doubtless like ... the most salient aspect of the series is that it's profoundly boring, wringing out sprinkles of drama as best it can." 
While on Live with Regis and Kelly, Anderson Cooper bashed the show during the opening segment of the chat show. Kelly Ripa proceeds to show Cooper what the show is about. Video of Cooper's comments was placed in the "Top 20 Best Clips of the Year" by The Soup when he stated "I cannot believe I'm wasting a minute of my life watching these horrific people."
