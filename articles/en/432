Maccabi Netanya F.C. (Hebrew:    , Moadon Kaduregel Maccabi Netanya) is an Israeli football club based in Netanya. Established in 1934, the club was a founding member of the Israeli League in 1949. After winning their first championship in 1971, the club's golden period lasted until the late 1980s, including three more league titles and a double in 1978.

== History ==
The club was established in the year 1934 as a Mandatory Palestinian Club and initially played in green and white stripes. The club's first season was in 1935-36 when they played in Liga Gimel which back then was the third tier in Israeli football. After three seasons in Liga Gimel the club won promotion to Liga Bet (second tier), and in the 1941-42 season they won Liga Bet to secure promotion to the top division which back then was known as the Palestine League.
They became founder members of the Israeli League in 1949, and in 1954 reached the State Cup final for the first time, losing 40 to Maccabi Tel Aviv. In 196162 the club finished bottom of Liga Leumit (then the top division) and were relegated to Liga Alef. They returned to the top division in 1964.
After a third-placed finish in 196869, the 197071 season saw Netanya win their first title by a margin of eleven points, back then the largest in Israeli football history. They also reached the State Cup final, but lost 21 to Maccabi Tel Aviv. In 197273 Neyanya finished thirteenth in Liga Leumit, avoiding relegation by only two points. However, the following season they won their second title. In 1975 they changed their kit to play in black and yellow. They won a third title in 197778, and completed the double by beating Bnei Yehuda 21 in the State Cup final. They also finished as winners of their group in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. A fourth championship was won in 197980 by a margin of ten points, whilst their fifth title, in 198283 was won by a fourteen point margin. In the same season they won the League Cup, a feat repeated the following year. In 198687 and 198889 they reached the League Cup final, but lost on both occasions.
In 199495 Netanya finished bottom of Liga Leumit and were relegated to Liga Artzit, in the same season the youth team won the youth championship. After winning the league in 199899 they returned to the top division. However, they were relegated again in 200304 after finishing second from bottom, though they made an immediate return to the top division after finishing as Liga Leumuit runners-up in 200405, a season in which they also won the Toto Cup Leumit.
In December 2005 Daniel Jammer, a Jewish German businessman bought the club for a fee of $1,500,000. In 200607 the club finished as Premier League runners-up, a feat repeated the following season. In April 2008 Lothar Matthus was appointed manager. Although the club led the league in the early part of the 200809 season, they eventually finished fourth and Matthus was sacked and replaced by Nati Azaria.
The 2010-11 season saw the club finishing sixth in the top playoff games. The next season Netanya finished in the fourth place when they shared the same amount of points as the runners-up. This was quite an achievement considering the fact that the club didn't have a stable budget behind them or an owner to invest in the club. They were relegated again in 2012-13 after finishing second from bottom.
In August 2013 Eli Segav and Yossi Maor took over as the new owners of the club. Netanya made an immediate return to the top division after finishing as the champions of Liga Leumuit in the 2013-14 season, a season in which they also reached the State Cup final, losing 10 to Ironi Kiryat Shmona in front of more than 22,000 supporters of Netanya.

== Rivalry ==
There is a strong rivalry between Netanya and Beitar Nes Tubruk Netanya. Originally, there were hopes of the two clubs uniting so as not to split allegiances of kids in the city. The merger never came to fruition and since, the two clubs have been at each other's throats both claiming that the other has forced a child not to switch clubs, which is illegal in Israel. On one occasion when two Tubruk players came to shake hands with Netanya players after a derby match in Liga Leumit LeNoar, they were subsequently left out of the team for the club's next league match . The senior derby took place when both clubs played in the second tier, in the 1962-63 season and in the 1963-64 season. The 198687 season was the only season the two teams played in the top division at the same time. The first game took place in Tubruk Stadium with 9,000 people in attendance, Yigal Menahem scored the only goal for Maccabi.
There's also a strong rivalry between Netanya and Hapoel Kfar Saba, games between the two are often called "Derby HaSharon" because the two clubs are known to be the major teams from the Sharon plain. The rivalry was at its peak in the 198182 season which saw the two clubs going head to head for the championship with Netanya losing the title in the final game of the season.
Since the late 1990s, the strongest rivalry has probably been Hapoel Beer Sheva.
