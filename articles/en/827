Radio magazine, a radio broadcasting trade publication, covers the technology side of radio broadcasting. The publication's focus is to deliver in-depth technical expertise while observing high standards of editorial content. Radio magazine is targeted at radio broadcast engineers, technology managers and owners of radio stations, networks, and recording studios. It is published by NewBay Media.

== History ==
Radio magazine was first published in 1994 under the title BE Radio. It is, essentially, a spin-off of Broadcast Engineering magazine, which began publication in 1959.
Prior to 1994, Broadcast Engineering (often known as "BE") covered radio, television, and cable broadcasting. In 1993, the editors of BE, recognizing a growing divergence in the technical issues faced by radio and television broadcasting, chose to split the scope of the original magazine. This resulted in the creation of BE Radio, to cover only the radio broadcasting industry, and narrowed the scope of Broadcast Engineering to television and cable broadcasting only.
As the readerships of the two magazines diverged, the "BE" initialism ceased to have relevance for BE Radio, and in 2001 the decision was made to drop the initials from the title, leading to the title of Radio.
In February 2011, Radio was transferred from struggling Penton Media to media and communications publisher NewBay Media, separating ownership of Radio from its parent Broadcast Engineering for the first time.
