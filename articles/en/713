The Elvira Drew Three-Decker is an historic three-decker at 42 Abbott Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. Built c. 1904, it represents part of a trend of building the form, traditionally associated with working-class housing, into the fashionable west side of the city. When the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, exterior Colonial Revival details were highlighted, including brackets in the eaves and porch columns that were Tuscan columns. Many of these details have subsequently been lost or covered over (see photo).
