In physics, the electronvolt (symbol eV; also written electron volt) is a unit of energy equal to approximately 160 zeptojoules (symbol zJ) or 69811600000000000001.61019 joules (symbol J). By definition, it is the amount of energy gained (or lost) by the charge of a single electron moved across an electric potential difference of one volt. Thus it is 1 volt (1 joule per coulomb, 70001000000000000001 J/C) multiplied by the elementary charge (e, or [1]69811602176620799991.6021766208(98)1019 C). Therefore, one electron volt is equal to 69811602176620799991.6021766208(98)1019 J. Historically, the electron volt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences because a particle with charge q has an energy E = qV after passing through the potential V; if q is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the terminal bias in volts, one gets an energy in eV.

The electron volt is not an SI unit, and its definition is empirical (unlike the litre, the light year and other such non-SI units), thus its value in SI units must be obtained experimentally. Like the elementary charge on which it is based, it is not an independent quantity but is equal to 1 J/C2h/0c0. It is a common unit of energy within physics, widely used in solid state, atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. It is commonly used with the metric prefixes milli-, kilo-, mega-, giga-, tera-, peta- or exa- (meV, keV, MeV, GeV, TeV, PeV and EeV respectively). Thus meV stands for milli-electron volt.
In some older documents, and in the name Bevatron, the symbol BeV is used, which stands for billion electron volts; it is equivalent to the GeV.

== MassEdit ==
By massenergy equivalence, the electronvolt is also a unit of mass. It is common in particle physics, where units of mass and energy are often interchanged, to express mass in units of eV/c2, where c is the speed of light in vacuum (from E = mc2). It is common to simply express mass in terms of "eV" as a unit of mass, effectively using a system of natural units with c set to 1. The mass equivalent of 70001000000000000001 eV/c2 is

For example, an electron and a positron, each with a mass of 69995110000000000000.511 MeV/c2, can annihilate to yield 69871637424369714001.022 MeV of energy. The proton has a mass of 69999380000000000000.938 GeV/c2. In general, the masses of all hadrons are of the order of 70001000000000000001 GeV/c2, which makes the GeV (gigaelectronvolt) a convenient unit of mass for particle physics:
70001000000000000001 GeV/c2 = 69731783000000000001.7831027 kg.
The atomic mass unit, 1 gram divided by Avogadro's number, is almost the mass of a hydrogen atom, which is mostly the mass of the proton. To convert to megaelectronvolts, use the formula:
1 amu = 7002931494100000000931.4941 MeV/c2 = 69999314941000000000.9314941 GeV/c2.

== MomentumEdit ==
In high-energy physics, the electron volt is often used as a unit of momentum. A potential difference of 1 volt causes an electron to gain an amount of energy (i.e., 69811602176487000001 eV). This gives rise to usage of eV (and keV, MeV, GeV or TeV) as units of momentum, for the energy supplied results in acceleration of the particle.
The dimensions of momentum units are LMT1. The dimensions of energy units are L2MT2. Then, dividing the units of energy (such as eV) by a fundamental constant that has units of velocity (LT1), facilitates the required conversion of using energy units to describe momentum. In the field of high-energy particle physics, the fundamental velocity unit is the speed of light in vacuum c. Thus, dividing energy in eV by the speed of light, one can describe the momentum of an electron in units of eV/c. 
The fundamental velocity constant c is often dropped from the units of momentum by way of defining units of length such that the value of c is unity. For example, if the momentum p of an electron is said to be 69901602176487000001 GeV, then the conversion to MKS can be achieved by:

== DistanceEdit ==
In particle physics, a system of "natural units" in which the speed of light in vacuum c and the reduced Planck constant  are dimensionless and equal to unity is widely used: c =  = 1. In these units, both distances and times are expressed in inverse energy units (while energy and mass are expressed in the same units, see massenergy equivalence). In particular, particle scattering lengths are often presented in units of inverse particle masses.
Outside this system of units, the conversion factors between electronvolt, second, and nanometer are the following:

The above relations also allow expressing the mean lifetime  of an unstable particle (in seconds) in terms of its decay width  (in eV) via  = /. For example, the B0 meson has a lifetime of 1.530(9) picoseconds, mean decay length is c = 6996459699999999999459.7 m, or a decay width of 6977689256324707400(4.30225)104 eV.
Conversely, the tiny meson mass differences responsible for meson oscillations are often expressed in the more convenient inverse picoseconds.

== TemperatureEdit ==
In certain fields, such as plasma physics, it is convenient to use the electronvolt as a unit of temperature. The conversion to the Kelvin scale is defined by using kB, the Boltzmann constant:

For example, a typical magnetic confinement fusion plasma is 698524032647304999915 keV, or 170 megakelvin.
As an approximation: kBT is about 69794005441217500000.025 eV ( 290 K/11604 K/eV) at a temperature of 700229315000000000020 C.

== PropertiesEdit ==

The energy E, frequency v, and wavelength  of a photon are related by
 
where h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light. This reduces to
 
A photon with a wavelength of 6993532000000000000532 nm (green light) would have an energy of approximately 69813733071214710002.33 eV. Similarly, 69811602176487000001 eV would correspond to an infrared photon of wavelength 69941240000000000001240 nm or frequency 7014241800000000000241.8 THz.

== Scattering experimentsEdit ==
In a low-energy nuclear scattering experiment, it is conventional to refer to the nuclear recoil energy in units of eVr, keVr, etc. This distinguishes the nuclear recoil energy from the "electron equivalent" recoil energy (eVee, keVee, etc.) measured by scintillation light. For example, the yield of a phototube is measured in phe/keVee (photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent energy). The relationship between eV, eVr, and eVee depends on the medium the scattering takes place in, and must be established empirically for each material.
