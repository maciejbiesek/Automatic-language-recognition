Thomas Brennan (1886  22 January 1953) was an Irish Fianna Fil politician who sat for 9 years as a Teachta Dla (TD) for Wicklow.
A building contractor before entering politics, Brennan first stood for election to Dil ireann at the 1943 general election, but failed to win a seat. The following year, at the 1944 general election, he unseated his Fianna Fil colleague Christopher Byrne and took his seat in the 15th Dil. He was re-elected at the 1948 election and again at the 1951 general election, but died on 22 January 1953.
The by-election for his seat was held on 18 June, and won by the Fine Gael candidate Mark Deering. At the 1954 general election his son Paudge Brennan regained the seat for Fianna Fil, beginning a 30-year career in the Oireachtas.
