Area code 815 is a telephone area code for most of northern Illinois, outside of the Chicago and Quad Cities areas.
815 was one of the four original Illinois area codes set up in 1947. It was split in 1957, when most of its western portion was combined with part of the northern portion of area code 217 to form area code 309.
In preparation of an overlay area code (779), all calls from the 815 area needed to be dialed with an area code beginning on February 17, 2007. A month later, the 779 code was activated.
