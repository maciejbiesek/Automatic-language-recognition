Hei t bebi (literally, "bottom layer") is the lowest of the four layers in the Yanomam cosmos. According to Yanomam tradition, hei t bebi was created after a piece of hedu k misi (heaven) fell onto Hei k misi (earth). The falling piece of hedu knocked a hole into hei k misi, creating a hole and dislodging a swathe of earth which fell below forming hei t bebi.
When this fell through hei k misi it took with it the garden and shabono (village) of Amahiri-teri, but it did not take the surrounding jungle. As a result, the landscape of Hei t bebi is barren and desolate. The people and village of Amahiri-teri got trapped there, and as a result were forced to turn to cannibalism. Using their spiritual powers, they capture the souls of children from hei k misi for food.
