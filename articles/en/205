The Raflet Stamp Club (formed 1958) is a postal-only stamp club with over 1000 members.
The club was founded by A.G.(Geoff) Groom who was a teacher. Groom was Secretary of the Royal Air Force Association Stamp Club from 1951 to 1958, and formed Raflet after the RAFASC was wound-up. Despite the name and some loose Royal Air Force associations, Raflet is not formally associated with the R.A.F. and membership is open to anyone.
The society runs a regular auction, post-shop and circulating exchange packet system where members may buy and sell stamps for their collections. A regular journal, The Raflet Philatelic Magazine, is issued which won a Silver Medal at the Autumn 2000 Stampex Philatelic Exhibition.
Air Marshal Ian Macfadyen has been the President of the society since 1992.
