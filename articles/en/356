Padri-Ki-Haveli ("Mansion of Padre"), also known as St Mary's Church, it is the oldest church in Bihar. When Roman Catholics arrived in Bihar, they built a small church in 1713 at a place now known as Padri-ki-Haveli.
The current church was re-designed by a Venetian architect Tirreto in 1772. He came from Kolkata to design this church. The foundation stone of this huge church has a dimension of 70 feet in length, 40 feet wide and 50 feet in height.
Nawab Mir Qasim destroyed this church because of the quarrel with the British traders on 25 June 1763. Ancient records were destroyed and burnt consequently. Later, in 1857 during the Great Indian Rebellion again this church suffered with many damages.
Today, the monument stands as an architectural wonder with intricate details which can be seen in few other churches of India.

== NotesEdit ==
The main attraction of the church is the large cathedral bell.
Mother Teresa got her training in this church.
