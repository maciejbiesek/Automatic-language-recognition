The Paraplane GE-2 Golden Eagle is an American powered parachute that was designed and produced by Paraplane International of Medford, New Jersey. Now out of production, when it was available the aircraft was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.

== Design and development ==
The aircraft was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles exemption rules for two-seat trainers as well as Experimental - Amateur-built rules. It features a 560 sq ft (52 m2) parachute-style wing, two-seats-in-tandem accommodation with a cockpit fairing, tricycle landing gear and a single 65 hp (48 kW) Hirth 2706 engine in pusher configuration.
The aircraft carriage is built from bolted aluminium tubing. In flight steering is accomplished via a unique patented weigh-shift steering system. On the ground the aircraft has nosewheel steering. The main landing gear incorporates spring tube suspension. The aircraft has a typical empty weight of 330 lb (150 kg) and a gross weight of 850 lb (390 kg), giving a useful load of 520 lb (240 kg). With full fuel of 10 U.S. gallons (38 L; 8.3 imp gal) the payload for the pilot, passenger and baggage is 460 lb (210 kg).
The standard day, sea level, no wind, take off with a 65 hp (48 kW) engine is 200 ft (61 m) and the landing roll is 125 ft (38 m).
The manufacturer estimates the construction time from the supplied kit as 40 hours.

== Operational history ==
In April 2015 no examples were registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration, although one had been registered at one time.
