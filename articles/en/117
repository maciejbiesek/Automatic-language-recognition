"Cry Now, Laugh Later" is a song by Grace Jones from her 1982 album Living My Life.

== Background ==
The single was released in the U.S. and Canada only, simultaneously with "My Jamaican Guy" which was aimed at the European, Asian and Australian market. The 12" remix of the track, by Steven Stanley, is especially notable in the Grace Jones discography as it differs substantially from the album version. It more or less only retains the lead and backing vocals from the original and has new overdubs of drums, bass and keyboards - and a different chord progression on the choruses. In the UK the Steven Stanley remix of "Cry Now, Laugh Later" was released as the B-side of the "My Jamaican Guy" 12" single. Both the 12" remix and the 12" dub of "Cry Now, Laugh Later" remain unreleased on CD.
