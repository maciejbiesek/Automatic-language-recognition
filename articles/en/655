The Kurobe River (, Kurobe-gawa) is a river in Toyama Prefecture, Japan. 86 kilometres (53 mi) in length, it has a watershed of 689 km.
The river rises from Mount Washiba in the Hida Mountains and carves the deep valley known as the Kurobe gorge. It comes out of the mountains at Unazuki and forms an alluvial fan which directly sinks into the Sea of Japan.
The Kurobe River's rich flow and steep gradient offer good conditions for hydroelectricity. The Kurobe Dam is the tallest dam in Japan.
The name Kurobe is meaningless in Japanese. It appears to be an Ainu name, kur pet [kubet] 'shady river'.
