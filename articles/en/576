Passage to Music is an album by American jazz saxophonist David S. Ware recorded and released in 1988 on the Swedish Silkheart label. Besides tenor sax Ware plays saxello, a variant of the soprano sax played by English jazz musician Elton Dean, and stritch, a straight alto sax associated with multi-instrumentalist Rahsaan Roland Kirk. The CD edition adds two bonus tracks.

== Reception ==
In his review for AllMusic, Scott Yanow states "David Ware's searching improvisations reward repeated listenings by open-eared listeners." The Penguin Guide to Jazz states "Passage To Music has something of Ayler's and Sander's Afro-mysticism and constitutes something of a personal initiation".
