The Asian Open Figure Skating Trophy (or Asian Trophy; previously known as the Asian Figure Skating Championships) is an annual figure skating competition sanctioned by the Asian Skating Union. Skaters compete in the disciplines of men's and ladies' singles across three levels: novice, junior, and senior. Starting from year 2011 onward, the International Skating Union(ISU) officially approved to include Basic Novice A (age 10 to below 13) and B (age 13 to below 15) as competition groups on top of advance novice (age 10 to below 15). Thus making a total of 3 sub-groups under novice level in all ISU and ASU competitions.
Following an ASU meeting in Changchun, China during the 6th Asian Winter Games 2007, the ASU revised the name of the competition from the Asian Figure Skating Championships to the Asian Figure Skating Trophy, with the International Skating Union approving the change. Since 2013, the event has been titled the Asian Open Figure Skating Trophy and skaters from other continents have participated.
