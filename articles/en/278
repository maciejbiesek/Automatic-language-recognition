Community Christian College (CCC) is a private Christian two-year college located in Redlands, California, USA. Currently exclusively offers an associate's degree in Liberal Arts, generally for students who later plan to transfer to a four-year university.

== History ==
The College was incorporated in June 1994 as a nonprofit corporation for the public benefit. It is governed by its own self-perpetuating Board of Trustees, and, as such, is legally and financially independent of any church, denomination, or educational institution. The College's trustees, now 14 in number, include educators, business persons, pastors, and leaders of Christian non-profit organizations, all representing a wide range of denominations and Christian fellowships.

== Locations ==
CCC operates three regional campuses in Redlands, Sun Valley, and San Bernardino. Many of the classes given outside of the Redlands campus are provided through Polycom (a teleconferencing system), where a professor on the Redlands campus can give his lecture to students on the Sun Valley and/or the San Bernardino campuses. The Polycom system also allows for students on one campus to interact audio-visually through two-way conversations with professors and fellow students on the other campuses.

== Accreditation ==
Since 2007, Community Christian College has been accredited by Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS).
