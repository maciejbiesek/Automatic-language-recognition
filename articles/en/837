Bunny Bleu (born Kimberly Sue Warner on June 1, 1964) is an American pornographic actress.
She was discovered by William Margold, and entered the porn business in 1983, initially working as a fluff girl. She later found work in films and worked alongside notables such as Traci Lords and Christy Canyon. For more than a decade until well into her twenties she was still cast as a teenager due to her youthful appearance. Her hair was usually dyed blonde. She was known to be enthusiastic, but had trouble learning lines. After she starred in one of the first of Catalina Videos bisexual films, she had difficulty finding work in straight porn, as actors afraid of AIDS refused to work with her. Between 1983 and 1989 she performed in over 150 films. After leaving the industry in 1989 for three years, she returned in 1992 after having breast enlargement surgery and changing her hair color to her natural auburn. In honor of her contribution to the industry, Bleu was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame in 1997.
