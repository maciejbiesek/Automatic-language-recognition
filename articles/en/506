The Bridlington Principles are a set of rules that were aimed at resolving conflicts among trade unions. First drafted in 1939, they were initially required that unions did not attempt to "poach" each others' members, in the interests of a cohesive, non-conflictual atmosphere of industrial relations. They have been periodically updated, most recently in 2000. The current form of the rules is found in the TUC Disputes Principles and Procedures (2000).
