For the 2001 Tour de France, the organisers felt that the previous edition did not include not enough French teams and consequently changed the selection procedure as follows.
US Postal was selected because it included the winner (prior to disqualification) of the previous edition, Lance Armstrong.
Team Telekom was selected because it included the winner of the 2000 UCI Road World Cup (Erik Zabel).
Mapei-Quick Step was selected because it won the team classifications in the 2000 Giro d'Italia
Kelme-Costa Blanca was selected because it won the team classifications in both the 2000 Tour de France and 2000 Vuelta a Espaa.
This was extended to 16 teams based on the UCI ranking in the highest UCI division at the end of 2001, after compensating for transfers. The teams selected in this way were:Domo-Farm Frites-Latexco
iBanesto.com
ONCE-Eroski
AG2R Prvoyance
Bonjour
Cofidis
Crdit Agricole
Festina
Jean Delatour
Fassa Bortolo
Lampre-Daikin
Rabobank

Although initially it was announced that four wildcards would be given, the tour organisation decided to add five teams:Lotto-Adecco
CSC-Tiscali
Euskaltel-Euskadi
Franaise des Jeux
BigMat-Auber 93

In total, 21 teams participated, each with 9 cyclists, giving a total of 189 cyclists.
