Strzelecki was the original terminus station on the Strzelecki railway line in Victoria, Australia. It closed on 22 November 1930, after a timber trestle bridge on the section of line between Triholm and Strezlecki developed a large sway every time a train passed over it. It was deemed uneconomical to rebuild it and the section was closed after being in operation for only eight years. After this closure the terminus station was Triholm.
