=== Consumer Protection ===
"Joe Camel" Case - CGL's predecessor firm, Cuneo Law Group, PC, served as Washington counsel in the first case to challenge the "Joe Camel" cigarette advertising campaign. The action was filed in California state court in 1991 well before the U.S. Attorney General began tobacco litigation. This litigation led to the release of important documents that revealed R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company had studied under-aged smokers with a view toward selling cigarettes and consequently induced youths to start smoking through targeted advertising.

=== Corporate Governance ===
British Petroleum - For numerous disasters at British Petroleum (BP), CGL served as Washington counsel in BP P.L.C. Derivative Litigation, a successful stockholder derivative action against officers and directors of BP. The case alleged that defendants' misconduct resulted in various harms, including: major operating problems at the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, which caused a large crude oil leak; unacceptably high numbers of accidents and injuries at BP's Texas City, Texas refinery, which culminated in a 2005 explosion that resulted in 15 deaths; and widespread illegal price manipulation and fixing in the propane market, which has become the subject of an investigation by the federal government. The suit was settled in 2008. As a result of the suit, BP instituted significant corporate governance changes.

=== Product Liability ===
Entran II - CGL represented homeowners whose Entran II radiant heating systems allegedly contained defective pipe, yielding a $346 million bi-national settlement, one of the largest product liability settlements in history. On November 17, 2004, New Jersey District Court Judge Stanley Chesler gave final approval of this settlement.

=== Corporate and Financial Litigation ===
Enron - CGL served as Washington counsel for defrauded Enron investors from 2002 through 2008.
