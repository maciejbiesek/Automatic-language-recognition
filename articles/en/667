The Simeon Deming House is a historic residence in western Washington County, Ohio, United States. Located along Willis Road northeast of the community of Watertown, the house was built in 1815 as the residence of a veteran of the American Revolution. A native of Sandisfield, Massachusetts, Deming enlisted in the Continental Army in 1780 and was later promoted to an officer's rank.
The present structure is one of Ohio's oldest extant Federal houses, featuring brick walls that rest on a foundation of sandstone with a full basement. Two-and-a-half stories tall, and topped with a metal roof, the walls are built in Flemish bond. Central to the four-bay symmetrical facade is a rounded-arch main doorway with a transom and the original fanlight.
Deming personally remained in Washington County for only a short time; by 1824, he had moved north to the present Wayne County; in that year, he was one of the charter members of the First Presbyterian Church of Wooster. Despite living in Washington County for only a few years, Deming is seen as holding an important place in the area's history.
In 1980, the Simeon Deming House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Spread out around the 4 acres (1.6 ha) surrounding the house itself are seven related buildings that were added to the Register together with the house as contributing properties. The house qualified for inclusion on the Register for two different reasons: because of its association with Deming and because of its locally significant historic architecture.
