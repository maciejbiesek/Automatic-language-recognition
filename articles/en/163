On 4 July 2011, a Missinippi Airways Cessna 208 Caravan crashed when its pilot attempted to abort its take off from Pukatawagan Airport. The aircraft overran the runway and crashed into a ravine where it caught fire and was destroyed. One passenger was killed, the pilot and seven other passengers were injured and transported to hospital. None of those transported to hospital received life-threatening injuries.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft was a single-engined Cessna 208B Grand Caravan owned by Beaver Air Services and operated by Missinippi Airways; with a registration of C-FMCB and a manufacturer's serial number of 208B-1114. It had been manufactured and first flown in 2005.

== Investigation ==
An investigation is being carried out by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. The preliminary findings show that the aircraft ran off the runway and caught fire, but the cause of this is not yet known.

== Aftermath ==
The investigation led Transport Canada to revoke Missinippi Airways' air operator's certificate, for safety concerns. Without this, it is unable to fly commercial air services in Canada. The air operator's certificate was subsequently reinstated effective September 3, 2011.
On October 21, 2011 at 11:59 pm Transport Canada suspended the Air Operator Certificate again due to deficiencies with the company's Operational Control System after an inspection during the week.
On November 19, 2011 the Air Operator Certificate was again reinstated.
