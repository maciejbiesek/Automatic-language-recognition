The tenth and final season of CSI: Miami premiered on CBS on September 25, 2011, and is the shortest season of CSI: Miami with only 19 episodes. All members of the main cast returned for this season, whilst Eva LaRue planned to depart the cast subsequently. Adam Rodriguez wrote and produced the episode "At Risk", based on the Penn State scandal.
The series finale aired on April 8, 2012, but was delayed due to extended coverage of the Masters. In May 2012, CBS cancelled CSI: Miami, making it the first show in the CSI franchise to end.
