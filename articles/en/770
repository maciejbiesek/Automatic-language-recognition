Adelaide of Savoy (or Adelaide of Maurienne) (Italian: Adelaide di Savoia or Adelasia di Moriana, French: Adlade or Adle de Maurienne) (1092  18 November 1154) was the second spouse but first Queen consort of Louis VI of France. Adelaide was the daughter of Humbert II of Savoy and Gisela of Burgundy, and niece of Pope Callixtus II, who once visited her court in France.

== Queen of France ==
She became the second wife of Louis VI of France, whom she married on 3 August 1113/14 in Paris, France. They had eight children, the second of whom became Louis VII of France. Adelaide was one of the most politically active of all France's medieval queens. Her name appears on 45 royal charters from the reign of Louis VI. During her tenure as queen, royal charters were dated with both her regnal year and that of the king. Among many other religious benefactions, she and Louis founded the monastery of St Peter's (Ste Pierre) at Montmartre, in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Louis and Adelaide had seven sons and one daughter:
Philip of France (11161131)
Louis VII (112018 November 1180), King of France
Henry (11211175), Archbishop of Reims
Hugues (b. c. 1122)
Robert (c. 112311 October 1188), Count of Dreux
Constance (c. 112416 August 1176), married first Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne and then Raymond V of Toulouse.
Philip (11251161), Bishop of Paris. not to be confused with his elder brother.
Peter (c. 11251183), married Elizabeth, Lady of Courtenay

== Queen dowager ==
After Louis VI's death, Adlaide did not immediately retire to conventual life, as did most widowed queens of the time. Instead she married Matthieu I of Montmorency, with whom she had one child. She remained active in the French court and in religious activities.
Adlaide is one of two queens in a legend related by William Dugdale. As the story goes, Queen Adlaide of France became enamoured of a young knight, William d'Albini, at a joust. But he was already engaged to Adeliza of Louvain and refused to become her lover. The jealous Adlaide lured him into the clutches of a hungry lion, but William ripped out the beast's tongue with his bare hands and thus killed it. This story is almost without a doubt apocryphal.
In 1153 she retired to the abbey of Montmartre, which she had founded with Louis VII. She died there on 18 November 1154. She was buried in the cemetery of the Church of St. Pierre at Montmartre, but her tomb was destroyed during the Revolution.
