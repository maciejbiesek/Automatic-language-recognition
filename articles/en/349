The Northcote Tigers are a rugby league club based in Northcote, New Zealand. The club was founded in 1910 as the Northcote Warriors.
The Tigers compete in the Fox Memorial competition run by the Auckland Rugby League. Between 2000 and 2002 the Northcote Tigers competed in the national Bartercard Cup before being replaced by the North Harbour Tigers for three seasons. In 1994-1996 the North Harbour Sea Eagles in the Lion Red Cup were also based at the Birkenhead War Memorial.

== History ==

In 1909 members of the North Shore Rugby Union were so impressed with the new type of football they had seen that they decided to found a club for the 1910 season. Thus in 1910 the Northcote "Ramblers" League Football Club was born. It wasn't until 1948 however that the club qualified for the first grade and earned 'senior' status. In 1987 they finally won the Fox Memorial championship, under the coaching of David (the icon) Harding
