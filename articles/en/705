== Life and career ==
Germaine's father, David, walked out on her mother, Yvonne, and two elder brothers, Ian and Mark, before she was born. At school she was nicknamed "Tin Ribs" because she was so skinny. On the shores of Loch Lomond in Scotland on 14 February 1994 she married hairdresser Lea Carter (b. 1964) by whom she has a daughter, Daisy Louise (b. May 1995). "He's my brother's best friend, so I've known him for years," she said. Louise was taken on by an agent called Freddie's before being represented by Crawford's. When Louise was 21 she auditioned for the role of the cinema usherette Sylvia in Dennis Potter's Lipstick on your Collar. She did not capitalise on the success and notoriety of the show, preferring to bring up a family with her husband. Her last credit was in 1999 for the television series Sunburn.
