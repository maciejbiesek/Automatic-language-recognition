The Upriver Residential District is a 145-acre (59 ha) historic district in Natchez, Mississippi that was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It includes Colonial Revival, Late Victorian, Queen Anne, and other architecture, and has significance dating to 1790. It includes 389 contributing buildings. Its border was defined, on the south and west, by the borders of the already-NRHP-listed Natchez On-Top-of-the-Hill Historic District (essentially Monroe Street) and the Downriver Residential Historic District.
It includes the John Dicks House, which is believed to be the only work of McKim, Mead, and White in Mississippi and "one of the most outstanding Colonial Revival buildings in the state."
