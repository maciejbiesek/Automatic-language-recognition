The Reform Party of the United States of America held primary elections for its presidential candidate in May 2004. Ralph Nader was overwhelmingly endorsed as candidate.
For a time, it seemed as though industrialist Ted Weill, among the party's most widely respected members, would become the front-runner for the nomination. When he learned that Ralph Nader would also seek the party's nomination, he dropped out of the race and endorsed Nader's candidacy. He ultimately contributed thousands of dollars to Nader's political campaigns. During his acceptance speech at the 2004 Reform Party National Convention in Irving, Texas, Nader thanked Weill for his support.
