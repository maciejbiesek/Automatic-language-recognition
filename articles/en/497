In United States agricultural policy Paid diversion was a program, repealed by the 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127), under which farmers were paid to voluntarily take acreage out of production. The diverted land was devoted to approved conservation practices. Unlike acreage reduction and set-aside programs, participation in a paid diversion program was not normally a condition of eligibility for other support program benefits.
While the Conservation Reserve Program pays farmers to take land out of production, the objective is to achieve certain environmental objectives.
