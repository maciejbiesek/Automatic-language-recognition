atalca was settled throughout the Ottoman period, with a typical Ottoman mixed population of Greeks and Turks. The Crimean War caused a mass exodus of Crimean Tatars towards Ottoman lands. A few Crimean Tatars settled in atalca.
In the First Balkan War the Bulgarian army had driven the Turkish forces back from the border, but the Turkish forces retreated to the prepared positions at atalca where on 1617 November 1912 they defeated the Bulgarians at the "First Battle of atalca". The atalca fortifications formed a line across the peninsula, the "Chataldja line", which became the armistice line of 3 December 1912, after Bulgaria decided not to attack Adrianople at that time. Upon expiration of the armistice, on 3 February 21 January 1913, hostilities recommenced and the Second Battle of atalca began. It was a series of thrusts and counter-thrusts by both the Ottomans and the Bulgarians and lasted until 3 April 1913.
