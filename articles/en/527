For cycle, motor-cycle, motor-car, aeroplane and airship companies associated with French industrialist Adolphe Clment-Bayard - see Clement (disambiguation).
Clment-Stirling was a type of auto-mobile manufactured from 1898. It was fundamentally a French Clment-Panhard that was exported to Great Britain and sold by the Scottish coachbuilder 'Stirling' of Edinburgh as the 'Stirling dog cart'. Some were badged 'Stirling-Panhard' and others as 'Clment-Stirling'.
Adolphe Clment was a director of Panhard-Levassor, and when the factory could not meet the production requirements for circa 500 units of the 1898 'voiture lgre' ('dog cart') model, he undertook manufacture under licence at his factory in Levallois-Perret. It was designed by airship pioneer Commandant Arthur Krebs, of Panhard, and used a tubular chassis, centre-pivot steering, near-horizontal 3.5 hp (2.6 kW) rear-mounted engine with automatic inlet valve and hot-tube ignition, driving through a constant-mesh gear-train, and final drive by side chains and early models had no reverse gear.
