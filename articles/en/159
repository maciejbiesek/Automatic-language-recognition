Canons i Danses (sing. Can i Dansa - Catalan; English: Songs and Dances) is the title of a collection of 15 pieces by Federico Mompou, written between 1918 and 1972. All were written for the piano, except No. 13 for guitar and No. 15 for organ.

Each piece consists of an introductory slow Can, followed by a more animated Dansa in a related key but not necessarily in the same time signature. They are mostly based on existing Catalan folk tunes, although some of them are original works. Each takes between 3 and 5 minutes to play.
The Canons i Danses were not written as a set, but as discrete pieces over a 55-year span. Can i Dansa No. 1 is one of Mompou's best known works, and has been arranged for various combinations of instruments. No. 6 is also very well known.
Many of them have been recorded individually, by pianists such as: Arthur Rubinstein, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Stephen Hough, Stanislas Niedzielski, Artur Pizarro, Neil Galanter and others. The complete collection has been recorded by: the composer himself, Alicia de Larrocha, Martin Jones, Jordi Mas, Gustavo Romero, and Peter Fletcher (in his own arrangements for guitar).
