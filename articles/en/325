Aaron Craig Shingler (born 7 August 1987 in Aldershot) is a Wales international rugby union player and former cricketer.

== BackgroundEdit ==
Born in Aldershot, England, Shingler grew up in West Wales, attending Pontarddulais Comprehensive School and Gorseinon Tertiary College. His mother was born in Dumfries in southern Scotland. As he has represented the Wales Sevens team, Shingler is only eligible to represent the Wales national team. His younger brother, Steven, is also a professional rugby player.

Before turning to professional rugby, Shingler was a promising cricketer. He bats right-handed and is a right-arm medium-fast bowler. Having played for the previous three seasons in the Second XI, Shingler signed to the senior Glamorgan team for the 2007 season. However, he was released from the club at the end of the season. He played once for the England Under-19s team in a Youth One-Day International against Bangladesh in 2005 and has also played for Wales Minor Counties in the MCCA Trophy.

After being released by Glamorgan, Shingler signed for Welsh Premier Division rugby union side Llanelli RFC. In April 2009, he was promoted to the Scarlets regional side for their West Wales derby match against the Ospreys on 18 April. He then played in three of the Scarlets' four remaining fixtures, missing only the 458 away defeat by Leinster as he was playing for Llanelli in the 2009 WRU Challenge Cup final against Neath. He scored a solo 70-metre try, but it was not enough to prevent Neath from winning 2721. In 2010, Shingler was selected for Wales' 2010 Commonwealth Games Sevens squad.
In January 2012, he was called into Wales' 35-man senior squad for the training camp in Poland prior to the 2012 Six Nations Championship. He made his full international debut for Wales against Scotland on 12 February 2012.
