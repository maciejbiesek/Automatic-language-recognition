Walker Mountains (7213S 992W) is a range of peaks and nunataks which are fairly well separated but trend east-west to form the axis, or spine, of Thurston Island. They were discovered by Rear Admiral Byrd and members of the US Antarctic Service (USAS) in a flight from the ship Bear on February 27, 1940. Named by US-SCAN for Lt. William M. Walker, captain of the United States Exploring Expedition ship Island on March 23, 1839.
