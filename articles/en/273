Following a shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay area, LST-1064 loaded a cargo of ammunition at NWS Earle, New Jersey, and sailed for the Pacific war front, reaching Ulithi on 23 June 1945. As the end of the war approached, LST Group 99 advanced its operations to the Philippines, and at Leyte LST-1064 transferred her cargo to fleet ships while loading new supplies and embarking units of an air service group destined to strengthen the occupation forces in Japan. Two voyages to Yokohama took place between 4 October and 19 November before arrival of orders to return home.
LST-1064 spent Christmas 1945 at Saipan; New Year's Day on the high seas, and before the end of January 1946, liberty in California. After one year of service, inactivation commenced at Astoria, Oregon, culminating on 21 August when LST-1064 was fully decommissioned and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Columbia River Group.
She was named Nansemond County on 1 July 1955 after Nansemond County, Virginia, then was slated for disposal on 17 September 1959.
