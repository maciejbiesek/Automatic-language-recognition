Rabbi Rahabi Ezekiel, or Ezekiel Rahabi, (fl. 1750s) was a rabbinical writer known only through his polemical Hebrew translation of the New Testament - The Book of the Gospel Belonging to the Followers of Jesus (c.1750).
To be distinguished from David Ezekiel Rahabi (16941772), of Cochin who revived Judaism among Bene Israel Jews of India.
The translation is "in an uneven and faulty Hebrew with a strong anti-Christian bias." Oo 1:32 reads: "Heaven is my witness that I have not translated this, God forfend, to believe it, but to understand it and know how to answer the heretics . . . that our true Messiah will come. Amen." The 1750 edition appears to be the work of two different translators - a less educated Sephardi writer (Matthew-John) and a more educated German rabbi (Acts-Revelation).
