In geometry, the truncated cube, or truncated hexahedron, is an Archimedean solid. It has 14 regular faces (6 octagonal and 8 triangular), 36 edges, and 24 vertices.
If the truncated cube has unit edge length, its dual triakis octahedron has edges of lengths 2 and .

== Area and volumeEdit ==
The area A and the volume V of a truncated cube of edge length a are:

== Orthogonal projectionsEdit ==
The truncated cube has five special orthogonal projections, centered, on a vertex, on two types of edges, and two types of faces: triangles, and octagons. The last two correspond to the B2 and A2 Coxeter planes.

== Spherical tilingEdit ==
The truncated cube can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.

== Cartesian coordinatesEdit ==
The following Cartesian coordinates define the vertices of a truncated hexahedron centered at the origin with edge length 2:
(, 1, 1),
(1, , 1),
(1, 1, )
where  = .
The parameter  can be varied between 1. A value of 1 produces a cube, 0 produces a cuboctahedron, and negative values produces self-intersecting octagrammic faces.

If the self-intersected portions of the octagrams are removed, leaving squares, and truncating the triangles into hexagons, truncated octahedrons are produced, and the sequence ends with the central squares being reduced to a point, and creating an octahedron.

== DissectionEdit ==

The truncated cube can be dissected into a central cube, with six square cupola around each of the cube's faces, and 8 regular tetrahedral in the corners. This dissection can also be seen within the runcic cubic honeycomb, with cube, tetrahedron, and rhombicuboctahedron cells.
This dissection can be used to create a Stewart toroid with all regular faces by removing two square cupola and the central cube. This excavated cube has 16 triangles, 12 squares, and 4 octagons.

== Vertex arrangementEdit ==
It shares the vertex arrangement with three nonconvex uniform polyhedra:

== Related polyhedraEdit ==
The truncated cube is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.

=== Symmetry mutationsEdit ===
This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of uniform truncated polyhedra with vertex configurations (3.2n.2n), and [n,3] Coxeter group symmetry.
It is topologically related to a series of polyhedra and tilings with face configuration Vn.8.8.

=== Alternated truncationEdit ===
A cube can be alternately truncated producing tetrahedral symmetry, with six hexagonal faces, and four triangles at the truncated vertices. It is one of a sequence of alternate truncations of polyhedra and tiling.

== Related polytopesEdit ==
The truncated cube, is second in a sequence of truncated hypercubes:

== Truncated cubical graphEdit ==
In the mathematical field of graph theory, a truncated cubical graph is the graph of vertices and edges of the truncated cube, one of the Archimedean solids. It has 24 vertices and 36 edges, and is a cubic Archimedean graph.
