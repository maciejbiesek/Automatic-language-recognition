The Museum of Osteology is a private museum devoted to the study of bones and skeletons (osteology). This museum is located in Oklahoma City and features displays with the skeletons of over 300 species from animals all over the world, with another 5000 specimens off exhibit.

== Description ==

The museum was established by Jay Villemarette, founder of the company Skulls Unlimited International, Inc., which is located next to the museum. Construction on the museum began in 2004 and opened to the public on October 1, 2010. The museum focuses on the form and function of the skeletal system with numerous educational and taxonomic displays featuring all five vertebrate classes. The collections housed in The Museum of Osteology are the result of over 30 years of collecting by Jay Villemarette. Currently the collections consist of approximately 5,000 specimens representing over 2,500 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish.

In 2015, Skulls Unlimited opened a second location in Orlando, Florida which is now the largest Skeleton Museum in America with over 450 skeletons on display.
