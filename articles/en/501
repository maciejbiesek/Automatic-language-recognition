Phrynopus oblivius is a species of frog in the Craugastoridae family. It is endemic to Peru and only known from near its type locality near Maraynioc, in the Tarma Province, Junn Region, at about 3,220 m (10,560 ft) asl. It is known only from seven individuals found in remnants of a cloud forest, all beneath rocks next to a small creek. It shares its habitat with Gastrotheca griswoldi. It is possible that habitat loss is occurring in the general area of type locality.
