Heywood railway station is a disused station in the town of Heywood, Victoria, Australia. The last passenger train between Ararat and Portland was on 12 September 1981, operated by a DRC railcar. The platform and station building are still in place at Heywood although in a disused condition. Some of the former yard remains as unconnected BG track with power connections also provided to a work camp area.
