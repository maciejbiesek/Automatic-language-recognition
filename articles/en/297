Michael Choi is a comic book artist and video game concept artist, known for his work on books by DC Comics, Marvel Comics and Top Cow Comics, such as Witchblade, X-23 and X-Force.

== Early life ==
Michael Choi went to business school at The University of Texas at Austin, and graduated with a degree in Management Information Systems.

== Career ==
Choi worked at IBM for three years as an IT consultant before changing careers.
Choi penciled a six-issue Marvel entitled X23: Target X miniseries.
Michael Choi joined Marvel and penciled Uncanny X-Men from issue #495 to issue #499 with writer Ed Brubaker.
In the April 2007 issue of Wizard Magazine (#186) Choi was named number 10 of the "Hot 10 Artists" for his work on X-23: Target X. Said the magazine, "Choi pulls up the rear with his newly popular, vibrant pencils."
In 2010, Choi provided the illustrations in a pictorial featuring comedic actress Olivia Munn in the April/May 2010 issue of Complex magazine, and on its cover. The pictorial featured Munn interacting with illustrated animals in a forest setting, which were drawn by Choi and colored by Sonia Oback. Choi's approach to the visuals were inspired by the music video for the A-ha single "Take on Me".

In 2012, Choi provided the cover to Green Lantern vol. 5 #5, and guest pencilled issue #6.
