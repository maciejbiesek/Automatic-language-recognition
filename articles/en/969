The Klaer Lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst (literally: "clearly lighting mirror of the painting art") is a manuscript produced in 1692 by a Dutch author from Delft known only as A. Boogert. Only one copy of the manual is known, and it is completely handwritten and hand-painted. It is kept in the Bibliothque Mjanes in Aix-en-Provence. The manuscript contains 800 pages with various shades of watercolour paint, with the recipes used to produce them, as a color chart. It has been compared to the Pantone Matching System, which was produced 271 years later. The book has been digitised and made available on E-Corpus.
