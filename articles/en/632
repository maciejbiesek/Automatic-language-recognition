Musa: Ancestral Streams is a solo piano album by Stanley Cowell recorded in 1973 and first released on the Strata-East label. It features solo acoustic piano primarily but the song 'traveling man' is duet between electric piano (most probably fender rhodes and african thumb piano or kalimba)

== Reception ==
In his review for AllMusic, Jason Ankeny states "Musa Ancestral Streams remains a relative oddity in the pantheon of jazz's black consciousness movement -- a solo piano set of stunning reach and scope, its adherence to intimacy contrasts sharply with the bold, multi-dimensional sensibilities that signify the vast majority of post-Coltrane excursions into spiritual expression, yet the sheer soulfulness and abandon of Stanley Cowell's performance nevertheless vaults the record into the same physical and metaphysical planes".
