== Pech people ==
This area of Olancho is the home of one of the seven indigenous peoples living in Honduras, the Pech, formerly known as "Payas". As of early 2005, the Pech population had been reduced to 3,800. The Pech language is a member of the Chibchan family of languages, and, although it is still spoken by older people, it is in danger of extinction in the relatively near future. Despite modern influences the Pech still preserve their simple way of living and traditions.
