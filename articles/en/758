Suffrage Atelier was a publication collective campaigning for women's suffrage in England.
It was founded by Laurence Housman, Alfred Pearse, and Clemence Housman. Clemence was a writer, illustrator, and wood engraver, and her brother Laurence was a fantasy writer. Both were very politically motivated. The Atelier was formed to prepare for 21 June 1909 Womens Social and Political Union (WSPU) demonstration.
The Atelier, which became a major political entity, accepted as its members women who were professional illustrators in some form. It also encouraged non-professional artists to submit work, and paid them a small percentage of the profits. It ran printmaking workshops and held competitions. The Suffrage Atelier's policy was to produce only what could be quickly reproduced and circulated. Clemence Houseman was a well respected member of the WSPU, so much of the production of the Suffrage Atelier was distributed in the WSPU store chains and national newspaper.
The Suffrage Ateliers also had a large body of supporting subscribers that included both men and non-professionals. Subscribers were encouraged to submit fine art, poster and post card designs, craft work, and donations. Subscribers also helped organize pageants and exhibitions.
