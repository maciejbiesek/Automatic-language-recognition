Because the rail operators are government-assisted profit-based corporations, fares and ticketing on Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system are currently aimed at least in breaking even to at least compensate for their costs of running the system. The rail operators collect fares by selling electronic tickets capable of storing data, the price of which are calculated based on the distance between the start and destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-concessionary travel. From the information that was earlier written in these tickets, it is possible to increase the fare according to increments based on approximate distances between stations.
Stations on the MRT system are divided into two areas, paid and unpaid areas which allow the rail operators to collect needed fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates, also as access control gates. These gates, connected to a computer network, are capable to the electronic tickets, and can store information such as the amount of time taken per trip, and the start and destination stations per trip. This will thus allow the rail operators to collect fares based on this information.
The General Ticketing Machines (GTMs) at each station allow commuters to purchase value additions for their tickets or purchase tickets for single trips. Tickets for single trips, coloured in green, are valid only on the day of purchase, and have a time allowance of 30 minutes above the estimated travelling time between the destination and starting stations. Tickets that could be used repeatedly until its expiry date required a minimum amount of money in order to purchase both a new ticket or additional value.
It is possible for passengers to extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference as they exit their destination station. Using distance-based prices stands in contrast to utilising fare zones in some other subway systems such as the London Underground.
Although operated by private companies, the system's fare structure is regulated by the Public Transport Council, with the operators submitting requests for fare revision for approval. Fares are kept affordable by approximately pegging them to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to utilise the network and move away from past heavy reliance on the bus system. Recent fare increases in the past few years have raised the ire of the public.[1] There were also similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's lines, a disparity which SBS Transit justified by citing higher operational and maintenance costs, and lower ridership.

== Ticketing ==
Main articles: EZ-Link, NETS, and CEPAS

=== Tickets ===
Contactless smart cards replaced their magnetic ticket predecessors completely on 1 December 2002, making Singapore one of the first cities to implement contactless smart card payment on all the main modes of public transportation, along the likes of Hong Kong.
The ticketing system uses the EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay contactless smart cards based upon the Symphony for e-Payment (SeP) system for public transit built on the Singapore Standard for Contactless ePurse Application (CEPAS) system. This system allows for up to 4 card issuers in the market. The EZ-Link card was introduced on 13 April 2002 as a replacement to the original TransitLink farecard while its competitor the NETS FlashPay card entered the smart card market on 9 October 2009.

==== Stored Value Card ====
An adult EZ-Link card may be purchased for S$12 (inclusive of a S$5 non-refundable card cost and a S$7 credit) for payment of public transportation fares in Singapore. The card may be purchased at any TransitLink Ticket Office or Passenger Service Centre. The card may also be used for payment of goods and services at merchants displaying the "EZ-Link" logo, Electronic Road Pricing tolls and Electronic Parking System carparks.

=== Access Control Gates ===
Access control gates found in Singapore's MRT and LRT stations have evolved in design & features over the years. 4 different series of gates have been used in the MRT stations, and also different faregates have been used in LRT stations. All series of these gates are still working side by side in the MRT system, although the 2 oldest generations of these gates in the MRT stations have their faregates beginning to be removed starting from March 2010 and completed by October 2014.

==== First generation gates ====
The first generation faregates are made by Cubic. It originally accepted the now defunct magnetic farecard, and was upgraded to accept contactless smartcards in 2002. The VFD fare information display was slanted at an angle for some units. Some of the faregates are in the older text; while some had been upgraded to the newer text. Before the replacement of these faregates with TITAN faregates, they are located at most North South Line and East West Line stations.
It is already been phased out. Some of them originally had their older text which is those between 1987 and 1990.

==== Second generation gates ====
The second generation faregates are made by ST Electronics. It originally accepted the now defunct magnetic farecard, and was upgraded to accept contactless smartcards in 2002. The VFD fare information display slanted at an angle for all units; and had LED front entry/exit only display. Before the replacement of these faregates with TITAN faregates, they are located at selected North South Line and East West Line stations such as Expo, Orchard, Bedok, Kembangan, Paya Lebar, Dover and Raffles Place stations.
It is already been phased out.

==== Third generation gates ====

These are the standard sized gates you would normally see at every station. Each gate features CEPAS contactless smart card readers and 2 central retractable flaps. They are also ergonomically designed & made of stainless steel. Furthermore, they also feature a 6.5 inch LCD/TFT monitor which is used to display information about the ticket used by the passenger passing through the gate, as well as LED displays which show the operating status of the gate (whether it is for entry or exit).
It is located at all NEL stations, Sengkang LRT, Punggol East LRT, and CCL stations, the production orders have been ended in 2011.

==== Turnstile faregates ====
Turnstile faregates are for Bukit Panjang LRT, which originally accepted magnetic farecards. It was upgraded to accept stored value cards in 2002. It will be replaced by TITAN in 2016.

==== Fourth and TITAN generation gates ====
The fourth generation "Titan" gates will eventually replace the first and second generation gates that have been in use for over 20 years. These new gates will be 10% more energy efficient with low energy LED displays, LCD displays and servo-motors. The faregates are much smaller and wider compared to the two types of old gates. They will also be able to differentiate between human and inanimate objects, as there is no more green arrow and red cross signs, all of which replaced by illuminated bars. Red pin-holed sensors are removed, replaced by black plastic. It also makes low-buzzing sounds when there is error.it is in use in the North-South Line,East-West Line and Damai station at the Punggol LRT

==== Fifth generation gates ====
The fifth generation "Thales" faregates are located at new Downtown Line stations. The main difference from the other gates is that it uses glass flaps that swing instead of the usual retractable red flaps.

==== First generation wide gates ====
For Expo MRT Station, it originally accepts the magnetic farecards until it was removed by May 2003. All other stations only began to accept contactless smart cards for all faregates since April and May 2002, and applies to all the MRT stations that are built before 2002. It has an LED front entry/exit only display that is similar to ST Electronics, the LCD fare information and it is ergonomically designed.

==== Second generation wide gates ====
Each gate features contactless smart card readers capable of reading CEPAS cards and 2 central retractable flaps. They are also ergonomically designed & made of stainless steel. Furthermore, they also feature a 6.5 inch LCD/TFT monitor which is used to display information about the ticket used by the passenger passing through the gate, as well as LED displays which show the operating status of the gate (whether it is for entry or exit). These gates were designed for passengers with bulky luggage, prams, in wheelchairs or those who are disabled to use. These gates are much wider than the standard ones & feature 2 double retractable flaps. There will always be at least 1 in every station. For Changi Airport, because it serves airport passengers who are likely to carry bulky hand luggage, all gates at this station are of the wide gate variety. Since the opening of this station, all faregates originally had a metal hole for the magnetic farecard until it was removed by May 2003.
It applies to all stations that are built after 2002.

==== TITAN generation wide gates ====
All stations that are built after 2012 into the existing lines have the same features as TITAN, except with their premium-sized version for wheelchairs. Orchard,Jurong East and Damai stations have fitted with second generation wide gates.

The third generation wide gates is by Thales and it applies for the Downtown Line stations only.

==== Cronos Faregates ====
Designed with wide aisle gates, they promote independent access and passage for wheelchair-bound customers, the elderly, children and travellers with luggage. It is modern and uniquely contoured top cover design and intuitive lane guides provide enhanced visibility.
Located at all Bukit Panjang LRT stations.

=== Ticketing Machines ===
In the early years, single trip magnetic tickets were purchased at Ticket Vending Machines with coins only. Notes could be broken up into small change at a separate change machine. Those holding magnetic multi trip farecards could only reload their cards with additional credit at manual service counters or a separate Add Value Machine.
Today, the multi functional General Ticketing Machines have replaced their predecessors above for all of the passenger's ticketing needs. Through a touch screen monitor & a touch sensitive system map, these new generation of machines allow the passenger to reload the stored value in their EZ-Link Cards in cash (notes), through NETS & apply for automatic reload service through GIRO or VISA. Passengers can also purchase a Standard Ticket in cash (coins & notes), get a refund on their Standard Ticket deposit, check the value remaining in their EZ-Link Cards & view their past card transactions. 2 variations of the General Ticketing Machines are in use, differing only slightly in design as they are manufactured by different companies.

==== Change Machine (19871990s) ====
Notes are inserted and small change provided for use at the Ticket Vending Machine.

==== Add Value Machine (1990s2013) ====
