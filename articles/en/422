There is a significant Roma population in Mexico, most being the descendants of previous migrants. According to data collected by the Instituto Nacional de Estadstica y Geografa, they numbered 15,850, however, the total number is likely larger. In Mexico, they are commonly known as gitanos or rom.

== History ==
The first gypsy group in Mexico were the Spanish gitanos that arrived during the Colonial era.
Some of the mid-19th century migrants may have arrived to Mexico from Argentina.
In the late 19th and early 20th century migrants from Hungary, Poland and Russia began arriving. In 1931, after a substantial colony of these latter gypsies had settled, and following complaints of delinquency, the law was changed to prohibit further settlement in Mexico.
Today, their activities mainly revolve around the sale of textiles, cars, trucks and jewelry and also the teaching of singing and dancing.

== Culture ==
In the mid 1900s, Romani caravans were known for showing movies in rural towns (cine ambulante, traveling cinema).
