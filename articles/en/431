Lilium speciosum is an East Asian species of plants in the lily family. It is native to southern Japan and southern China, where it can be found on elevations of 600900 metres (2,0003,000 ft). It is sometimes called the Japanese lily though there are other species with this common name.
Lilium speciosum has flowers up to 1.2 metres (3 ft 11 in) by 0.3 metres (1 ft 0 in) in diameter, blooming from August to September in north temperate regions. The flowers are white to pink in colour, and strongly scented. It is later flowering than most other species. Many garden forms are in cultivation, and the species has been widely used for breeding of garden forms.
Lilium speciosum contains phenolic glycosides, such as 6-O-feruloylsucrose and (25R,26R)-26-methoxyspirost-5-en-3-ol 3-O--l-rhamnopyranosyl-(12)--d-glucopyranoside, and steroidal saponins.
