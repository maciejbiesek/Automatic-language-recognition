Just Surrender is a rock band from Dover Plains, New York, formerly known as A Second Chance. Just Surrender was formed by three high school friends from Dover High School in Dover Plains, NY, Jason Maffucci, Andrew Meunier, and Steve Miller. Vocalist/guitarist Dan Simons, formerly of "The Record Collection," joined the original three members; the group was a four-piece until 2008. The band is known for the up-beat mood in their music, and for not having a lead vocalist, but rather having two vocalists who "share the spotlight." The group has since released three studio albums and one EP.

== History ==

=== Origin and If These Streets Could Talk (2003-2005) ===
Just Surrender was formed in 2003 while the members were still attending high school. Just Surrender's first compilation was a 4 song EP. Many of the songs written for the EP were re-recorded for their first full album, If These Streets Could Talk, which was released by EastWest Records subsidiary Broken English in 2005. Recording took place at New York's Nada Recording Studios with producer John Naclerio. The band and their debut album appeared on MTV's You Heard It Here First. In reviewing the album, music critic Kate Lohnes wrote, "Overall, Just Surrender has panache. There's talent backing this heartfelt, although slightly unoriginal, release." Critic Christopher Felton described the album as "unfortunately nothing more than a half-decent attempt at copying the work of far more superior bands".

=== Touring and increased popularity (2005-2007) ===
The band quickly became popular on the music site PureVolume; they received more than 400,000 plays in a matter of months.
Just Surrender has toured with Autopilot Off, Bayside, My American Heart, TheStart, Cartel, Hawthorne Heights, Matchbook Romance, The Early November, Armor for Sleep, The Classic Crime, The Audition, All Time Low, Mayday Parade, Every Avenue, Set Your Goals, Powerspace, Bowling for Soup, We the Kings, Metro Station.
In 2005, Andrew Meunier left the band, and was replaced by Alex Haycraft. As of March 7, 2008, original guitarist, Andrew Meunier returned to the band. The band sent in a statement to AbsolutePunk.net that reads: "Just Surrender fans may have noticed on recent tours that original guitarist Andy Meunier has returned to the band. Alex Haycraft (formerly of Park) has moved over to bass."

=== We're In Like Sin and Stronger Now EP (2007-2009) ===
Just Surrender released the song "Body Language and Bad Habits" on their MySpace page on July 1, 2007. The song is from the album We're In Like Sin, released August 21, 2007. In reviewing the album, AbsolutePunk.net wrote, "Though not necessarily bigger, and far from innovative, Were In Like Sin is a worthy follow-up." Wonka Vision called it a "pop-punk" "guilty pleasure".
After the addition and returning from the UK they wrote and recorded for an EP titled Stronger Now that was released July 9, 2009. The EP was only made available at Warped Tour however, until released with iTunes on August 12. Stronger Now is significantly heavier than their previous albums and has been described as post-hardcore.
In November 2009, the band joined Hawthorne Heights for their Never Sleep Again tour.
With another recent lineup change, Alex Haycraft and Andy Meunier left the band. Kyle Shellhammer (formerly of The High Court) became the band's bassist, with Jolly Ubriaco filling the position of lead guitarist.

=== Phoenix and rumored indefinite hiatus (2010-2011) ===
On June 22, 2010, Just Surrender released their third full-length album called Phoenix. Two tracks, "Burning Up (Acoustic)" and "On My Own" have been released. It contains 12 tracks, including two previously released on the Stronger Now EP: the songs "Crazy", and "Stronger Now". On June 10, 2010 the band released a statement via their Facebook page stating that Phoenix would now be released June 22, 2010 through iTunes, and would be released through retail on July 13, 2010. "Take Me Home", the band's next single, was released June 15 through iTunes as scheduled. Just Surrender then toured with Hit The Lights, and The Maine on the Zumiez Couch Tour. The album was released and received positive critique.
There was a rumor that after a recent tour, Just Surrender would be going on indefinite hiatus. That rumor has been disputed by the band members' Facebook posts. A post by the band on Facebook strongly hinted towards an indefinite hiatus:
Despite rumored hiatus, Just Surrender has played many live shows since 2011.

=== Fourth studio album (2011-2014) ===
On December 19, It was reported that Just Surrender are writing material for a new album, which will be self-released, and that Ryan Kienle, formerly of Matchbook Romance, is the band's new bassist. Pitchfork has revealed a release of the new album to be set for Fall of 2012.

=== Resurgence (2015-Present) ===
On January 20, 2015 Maffucci announced via Facebook that the band had officially been released from their contract with Razor and Tie Record Company and will be recording a new EP to be released in the summer of 2015.
