The Liberal Party (Spanish: Partido Liberal, PL), also called Progress Party (Spanish: Partido del Progreso, PdP), was a Mexican political party founded in the early 19th century and involving characters like Jos Mara Luis Mora, Benito Juarez and Porfirio Daz.
When Mexico achieved its independence in 1821, the Mexican political life was altered by constant struggles between Liberals and Conservatives. The Liberal Party enacted the Federal Constitution of 1857, which along with the Plan of Ayutla (1854) and other liberal reforms polarized Mexican society to lead the Reform War (18571861), the Second French Intervention in Mxico (18621867) and the Second Mexican Empire (18631867).
