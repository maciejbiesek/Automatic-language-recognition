Southeast High School is a public high school in Bradenton, FL operated by the Manatee County School District & is the only public high school in Manatee County to offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) program.

== Admissions ==
Southeast High School is a public high school that takes in students from an area determined by the Manatee County School District. However, for admission into the IB program, applications are accepted through February of a student's eighth grade year. These applications consist of a 250-word essay, all report cards from middle school and the students' most recent FCAT scores in reading and mathematics. The application process is slightly different for students applying from Johnson Middle School, a local IB middle school.

== Curriculum ==
The tremendous diversity of Southeast High School results in a very complex curriculum, depending on whether the student is enrolled in the IB program or not. In addition, the school has a large population of students requiring special needs for mental and/or physical disabilities, with an entire wing dedicated to the education of special education students. Moreover, a 4-tiered academy system at the school allows students to graduate with specialties on their High School Diploma.

=== Traditional High School Students ===
For students that are not enrolled in the IB program, classes vary wildly depending on the credits earned in middle school. All traditional students are enrolled in Biology their freshman year, proceeding through the physical sciences and chemistry before graduation. Honors Physics classes are also available for students. Students have the option of taking Algebra I, Algebra II or Geometry as a Freshman, depending on their middle school credits, before moving on to Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry and (for a handful of students a year) AP Calculus A/B. They begin with English I and proceed through English II, III and IV for their sophomore, junior and senior years, respectively. Compared to students enrolled in the IB program, traditional students have more electives each year in high school.

=== International Baccalaureate Students ===
For students that are enrolled in the IB program, students are required to complete Algebra I, Algebra II, Geometry, Analysis and Functions and Trigonometry or Pre-Calculus and Trigonometry before their Senior year. In addition, unlike traditional students, IB freshmen are enrolled in Chemistry, taking Biology their sophomore year. All classes taken by IB students are taught at a higher level than their non-IB peers, with the prefix "PIB" appearing after the course title in freshman and sophomore year. These are counted as "Honors" classes and are given a higher weight for high school GPA calculation.
In Junior year, students officially enter the IB curriculum, determined by the IB Organization. Due to a limited student body, the diversity of classes taught at the IB level at Southeast High School is very small, with two main "tracks" being offered to students: on the one hand, some students opt for AP Calculus A/B and IB Mathematics SL, AP Biology and IB Biology HL and IB Physics SL; this track is referred to by students as the "Trifecta" On the other hand, some students opt for Analysis of Functions, IB Design Technology HL and IB Music SL, this track is referred to by studemts as the "Boom-fecta". Very few students mix the two tracks together.

=== Small Learning Communities (Academies) ===
There are four Academies offered at Southeast High School: Agriscience, Business and Consumer Science (ABC), Vocal and Performing Arts (VPA), Center for Leadership (CL), and Electronics Communications Center (ECC). Every student is required to sign up for an academy, however, participation is voluntary in most academies with the exception of VPA, which mandates that its students fulfill certain requirements. For all academies, if certain conditions are met, a special stamp is affixed to the high school diploma signifying completion of that academy and is recognized by some colleges.
