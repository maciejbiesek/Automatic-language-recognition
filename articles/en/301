Tappan Street is a surface-level station on the MBTA Green Line "C" Branch in Brookline, Massachusetts. The station is located in the median of Beacon Street just east of Tappan Street. The station consists of two side platforms which serve the "C" Branch's two tracks. The travel time from the station to Park Street is 29 minutes.
Electrified streetcars have been running on the section of Beacon Street west of Coolidge Corner, including stops at Tappan Street, since 1889. However, only since the 1980s have the surface stops begun to be considered stations as important as the underground stops, with defined names and dedicated signage.
Tappan Street has no bus connections and is not handicapped accessible.
