Stvarfjrur is a village in east Iceland. It sits on the Northern shore of the fjord of the same name, is part of the municipality of Fjarabygg and has 200 inhabitants.

== Geography ==
Stvarfjrur has a harbour and lies on Route 96 (Suurfjararvegur), at the foot of Hellufjall (859m). Most of the village lies on or close to the main street, Fjararbraut.
The other villages composing the municipality are: Eskifjrur (1,043 inh.), Fskrsfjrur (662 inh.), Mjifjrur (35 inh.), Neskaupstaur (1,437 inh.), and Reyarfjrur (1,102 inh.).

== Economy ==
Employment was once predominantly found in fishing, though now it is largely textile-based. Most of the young people have left, thus the community youth hall has been closed due to disuse.
Steinasafn Petru (Petra's Stone Collection) accounts for a modest stream of visitors during the tourist season. There are also galleries (Galler Snrs and Svartholi) and a handicrafts market in the salthouse (Salthsi). At Galler Snrs one can find a range of artwork, jewellery and textiles, including products from a local company that designs and manufactures a range of products made from recycled materials (MupiMup).
The town's formerly disused 2800m2 fish factory is currently being transformed into the HERE Creative Centre, which houses workshops for ceramics, wood and metal, art studio spaces, and a recording studio. The centre also hosts live music events, exhibitions, and visiting artists, providing a cultural hub for the town.
Accommodation is available at: Kirkjubr, a former church converted into a guesthouse; at the caf / bar / bed & breakfast (Saxa Guesthouse, formerly Kaffi Steinn), at a campsite, and at the seyri farmhouse (4km west of the village). Several other holiday rentals are also available.
There is also an internet caf / general store (Brekkan, formerly called Svarti Folinn), an outdoor swimming pool, self-service petrol station, ATM, bus stop and other services.

== Notable residents ==
Footballer var Ingimarsson is the best known former inhabitant of the town. His footballing career started at local youth club Slan, but he is best known for his spell at Reading in England where he played 281 games, 72 of which were in the Premier League.
