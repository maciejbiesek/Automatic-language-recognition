A "Lugade" is a nine yard Maratha sari. This nine yard sari is generally worn by elderly Hindu women and is sometimes referred to as Nauvaree in Marathi. It is usually between forty-two and forty-five inches in width, and has two lengthwise borders called kanth or kinar. It also has two breadthwise borders called padar, of which one is more decorated than the other.

== Draping a Lugade ==
The lugade is usually worn by tucking pleats into the underskirt at the back-center while the decorated end (padar) is thrown over the left shoulder. It is allowed to hang from the waist straight down and around like a skirt. Sometimes, this end is drawn over the bosom and back over the head.
