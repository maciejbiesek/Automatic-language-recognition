She has read her poetry at prestigious venues all over the world, including the Poets Stage in Stockholm, Urban Voices in South Africa, Rotterdams Poetry International Festival, the Aran Islands International Poetry and Prose Festival and on tour in Germany, Austria and Holland.

The book Blood Dazzler was the basis for a dance/theater production which sold out a week-long series of performances at New Yorks Harlem Stage.
A selection of her poetry was produced as a one-woman play by Nobel Prize winner Derek Walcott and performed at both Boston University Playwrights Theater and the historic Trinidad Theater Workshop. Another play, based on Life According to Motown, was staged by Company One Theater in Hartford, Ct., and reviewed favorably in The New York Times.

=== Controversy ===
As an editorial assistant at The Chicago Sun-Times in the late 1980s, she wrote a review of a concert that she had not attended.
She gained notoriety when The Boston Globe asked her to resign after editors discovered her metro column contained fictional characters and fabricated events in violation of journalism practice.

== Awards ==
Her book Shoulda Been Jimi Savannah was awarded the 2014 Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt Award. She is also a 2008 National Book Award finalist, winner of the Hurston-Wright Legacy Award in Poetry, the Carl Sandburg Literary Award, the National Poetry Series award, the Patterson poetry award, two Pushcart prizes, and the Rattle poetry prize. She also won the Robert L. Fish Memorial Award for short story writing and had work selected to appear in both "Best American Poetry" and "Best American Essays." In 2006, she was inducted into the International Literary Hall of Fame for Writers of African Descent, and she was the recipient of both McDowell and Yadoo fellowships. And for "Shoulda Been Jimi Savannah," she won the Lenore Marshall Prize, presented by the Academy of American Poets in recognition of "the most outstanding book of poetry" published in America the previous year.
She won the Distinguished Writing Award for Commentary from the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE), 1997. However, the Boston Globe returned the ASNE award and withdrew her from consideration for a Pulitzer Prize after the newspaper acknowledged that some of her columns contained fabricated people, events and quotes. Smith admitted to four instances of fabrications in her columns. She was asked to resign from the Globe after this revelation.
