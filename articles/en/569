== Reception ==
In his review for Allmusic, Jonathan Widran said "the album swings mercurially from mood, paying strict homage at times but also reminding the listener that centuries have passed and it's time for new twists on the sacred. One's enjoyment will depend solely on his or her passion for tradition, but overall, for the adventurous, Plays Mozart is worth at least one test spin". On All About Jazz Troy Collins said "Working in klezmer and Dixieland variations, as well as free jazz, psychedelic rock and even subtle electronica, Caine can seem mighty irreverent to the old guard. But he also contributes pieces of unflagging beauty and tenderness, proving his point that all forms (from the sacred to the profane) can exist on the same plane, if only one allows them". JazzTimes reviewer, Andrew Lindemann Malone, observed "Caines playful deconstructions and augmentations deliver tons of delightful surprises".
