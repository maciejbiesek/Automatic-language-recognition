Belemnites is a genus of an extinct group of cephalopods belonging to the order Belemnitida. These cephalopods existed in the Early Jurassic period from the Hettangian age (196.5199.6 mya) to the Toarcian age (175.6183.0). They were fast-moving nektonic carnivores.
Be careful not to confuse the scientific name Belemnites of this genus with the common name of the cephalopods included in the extinct order Belemnitida (commonly referred to as "Belemnites").
