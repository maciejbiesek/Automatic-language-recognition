Ant & Dec's Push the Button is a game show which first aired on ITV. The show is hosted by Ant & Dec. During the show the contestants compete to win a jackpot of 100,000. The family who have banked the most cash go through to the final to face DAVE. The game show is voiced over by Matt Berry, replacing Ronnie Corbett.
In series 2, the programme changed to being broadcast live. It featured an additional round called "The Accumulator", which gave the families a chance to increase their cash prize (that counts down throughout the show). Also, the winning family had a chance to play in the next game the following week to increase their money.
