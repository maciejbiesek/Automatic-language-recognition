Imre Varadi (born 8 July 1959) is an English former professional footballer of Hungarian origin, known as a journeyman forward who appeared for 16 different clubs at all levels of professional football in England.

== Playing career ==
Born in Paddington, Varadi started out in non-league football with Letchworth before joining Sheffield United in 1978, shortly before his nineteenth birthday.
Varadi went on to become a nomadic journeyman, who rarely spent more than two years with any club and never made 100 league appearances in the colours of any team he played for.
From Sheffield United, he moved on to Everton, Newcastle United, Sheffield Wednesday, West Bromwich Albion, Manchester City, Swansea Town, Sheffield Wednesday again, Leeds United, Luton Town, Oxford United, Rotherham United, Mansfield Town, Boston United, Scunthorpe United and finally had a spell as player-manager at Matlock Town. He was part of the Leeds United side that won the old First Division in 1992 but only played in three matches which was not enough games to earn a winner's medal. In 1984 he was approached by the Hungarian FA as to his willingness to play for Hungary, but he turned them down, pointing out that they already had good strikers and attacking midfielders.

== Post-retirement ==
He became a fully licensed FIFA Agent in March 2004 and provides commentary on games for both PA Sport and BBC Radio Sheffield.
