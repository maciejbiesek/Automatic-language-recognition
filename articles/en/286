HMS Baltimore was a Royal Navy sloop-of-war launched in 1742, designed by and named after Lord Baltimore who at the time was a Lord of the Admiralty .
As launched, the Baltimore had bilander rig, but in 1743 she was fitted with a conventional snow rig. Although her sides were pierced for 18 guns, she actually carried 14 four-pounders. In 1758 she was converted to a bomb vessel.
