Ralph Natale is a former American mobster. He was the leader of the Philadelphia crime family from 1995 until 1999, when he became the first American Mafia boss to turn state's evidence.
Described by himself as a friend of former Philadelphia boss Angelo Bruno, Natale's mob association began when he became boss of the Bartenders Union Local 170, allegedly running it on Bruno's behalf. In 1979, Natale was convicted of firebombing a furniture store in an insurance fraud scheme and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. The following year he was convicted of selling cocaine and received a 15-year sentence. He was released on parole in 1994.
Natale was initiated into the faction of the Philadelphia family led by Joey Merlino during the latter's power struggle with boss John Stanfa. Upon Stanfa's 1994 arrest Natale began to assume the duties of boss while Merlino, concerned over attention from law enforcement, took the position of underboss. Merlino's associate's would later describe Natale as primarily a front boss for Merlino.
In June 1998 Natale was jailed for parole violation when the government proved his continued association with Philadelphia mobsters; Merlino subsequently took control of the family and cut off support to the imprisoned boss. Angered by this, Natale offered to secretly record conversations with Merlino, but it was not until September 1999, when he was indicted for financing drug deals, that he formally struck a deal to cooperate.
Natale testified against Merlino during his 2001 racketeering trial, but was unable to secure a conviction for the murders he alleged Merlino committed.
In 2005 Ralph Natale was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment. He was released in May 2011 and is in witness protection.
