=== Perfume, cosmetics ===
In 1980 Silvio Denz took over the management of Zurich-based Alrodo AG, at that time was owned by his father and uncle. Initially with eight employees, the company was engaged in purchasing perfumes and cosmetics for imported perfumery retailers. After acquiring all the equity in Alrodo in 1984, he built up the company over the next 20 years to become Switzerland's largest perfumery chain, with 120 branches. Between 1980 and 2000, the number of employees rose from 8 to 800. In 2000 Silvio Denz sold Alrodo to the French perfumery chain Marionnaud. In the same year he founded Art & Fragrance S.A. specializing in the creation, production and international marketing of perfume and cosmetic brands such as Perfumes Alain Delon, Parfums Grs, Perfumes Lalique, Jaguar Fragrances, Bentley Fragrances and Ultrasun.

=== Wine ===
In 1994 Silvio Denz, along with Franz Wermuth and five other partners, founded Les Grand Vins Wermuth S.A. in Zurich, today Switzerland's foremost wine trading company and largest wine auction house. In 1998, acting with the same partners, he bought the Clos d'Agon estate on the Costa Brava, which is overseen by the oenologist Peter Sisseck (Dominio Pingus). In 2002 Denz bought a stake in the Spanish wine trading company Casa de Vino Ebinger S.A., owned by his friend Frank Ebinger, which is domiciled in Zurich.
In 2005, on the recommendation of his friend Count Stephan von Neipperg (Chteau Canon-la-Gaffelire and La Mondotte), Denz bought the Chteau Faugres estate, six kilometers east of Saint Emilion. Faugres, which has 30 employees, comprises three vineyards: Chteau Faugres, Chteau Pby Faugres, both lying in the Saint-Emilion appellation, and Chteau Cap-de-Faugres in Ctes de Castillion. In 2007 he bought Chteau de Chambrun, situated in Lalande-de-Pomerol, and in 2010, he and Peter Sisseck took over the historic vineyard of Chteau Rocheyron in Saint-Emilion. The estates in Bordeaux cover a total of 120 hectares.
The winery at Chteau Faugres was designed by the architect Mario Botta. He describes his creation as a "cathedral of wine". Using modern technology coupled with traditional methods, such as gravity-filling, the wines are aged in oak barrels. In 2012 Chteau Faugres and Chteau Pby Faugres were awarded the status of Grand Cru Class of Saint-Emilion. According to the wine critic Robert Parker, Chteau Pby Faugres today ranks among the finest Bordeaux wines. In February 2014, Silvio Denz acquired Chteau Lafaurie-Peyraguey, one of the few Premiers Grands Crus Classs of 1855 and one of the oldest vineyards in Sauternes. Silvio Denz's wine businesses are consolidated in two companies: Vignobles Silvio Denz  and Art & Terroir.

In 2008 Art & Fragrance S.A., Zollikerberg, Switzerland, the company founded by Silvio Denz and quoted on the Berne stock exchange since 2007, acquired the French crystal manufacturer Lalique S.A., Wingen-an der-Moder in Alsace. The company is involved in crystal glass, jewelry, perfume, interior design and art.
