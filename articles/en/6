Cathal mac gn is an ancestor of the  CathailCahill family of County Galway.
Cathal was a member of the U Fiachrach Aidhne, and a thirteen-time great-grandson of Nath , King of Connacht. His grandchildren and great-grandchildren were the first to bear the surname  Cathail (i.e., ua Cathal, grandson/descendant of Cathal) and until the 13th century would contest the kingship of Aidhne with the descendants of Seachnasach mac Donnchadh, Scannln mac Fearghal, Eidhean mac Clireach and Giolla Ceallaigh mac Comhaltan. While the family did provide a number of rulers of the area, ultimately Cathal's descendants were overthrown and suppressed by the descendants of Seachnasach mac Donnchadh, and remained a minor family until the end of Gaelic Ireland.
Cahill is the name of a number of distinct families in Ireland, and not all are related.
