Lin Gui (born 1 October 1993 in Nanning, China)  is a table tennis player from Brazil. She naturalized Brazilian in 2012 and was selected to be part of the Brazilian National Team competing in table tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She currently trains under the supervision of Pan-American Medalist Hugo Hoyama.

== Personal lifeEdit ==
Lin Gui has been living in Brazil since the age of 12 as an exchange student and naturalized Brazilian at the age of 18. She speaks fluent Portuguese and identifies with Brazilian culture, claiming to be "Brazilian at heart from birth". She currently lives in Sao Bernardo do Campo where she trains with Hugo Hoyama, who, like her, identifies with soccer team Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras.

== CriticismEdit ==
She has been the target of criticism for being selected over Jessica Yamada to be the third player on the Brazilian Team for the 2012 Olympic Games despite being lower-ranked at the time. The Brazilian Team coach argued that his choice for Gui was technical, stating that Gui was currently the best Brazilian player overall and was lower-ranked due to injuries in the previous season, which made her unable to play and consequently dropping positions on the ranking.
