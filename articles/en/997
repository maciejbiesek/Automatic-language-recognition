== Early lifeEdit ==
Miller was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School (VASJ) where he was a two-sport star between basketball and football. Miller was the starting point guard for all four seasons in basketball and led them to a state championship as a senior in 199192. In football, he became the starting quarterback in his sophomore season, succeeding future National Football League quarterback Elvis Grbac. Miller led the football squad to a state championship as a junior, a feat Grbac did not even accomplish. He wasn't heavily recruited from college basketball teams because it was thought he would play football at the next level instead, but then-Marquette head coach Kevin O'Neill was persistent in his recruitment, and eventually Miller signed to play for the Warriors.
