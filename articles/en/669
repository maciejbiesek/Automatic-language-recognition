Melanie R. Cline (born June 29, 1975) is an American former amateur "Old/Mid School" Bicycle Motocross (BMX) racer whose prime competitive years were from 19822004 and 2009 to the present.
Born in Westland, Michigan, she was one of the first generation of female BMX racers to become well known after the 19801986 era dominated by Debbie Kalsow, Kathy Schachel, Gaby Bayhi and Cheri Elliott. Melanie Cline could more than hold her own against the boys, often racing in the "Open" class at nationals in which boys and girls raced in the same age bracket9- and 10-year-olds and 11- and 12-year-olds for examplecompete as opposed to the girls only division. She regularly made those Open mains and even won many of them. She won five such Opens at nationals in 1987 in the 11- and 12-year-old class. Her nicknames "Swell Mel" or just "Mel" are obvious plays on her first name Melanie. She was also known as "Speed Queen". Melanie went on to win 4 World Championships as well as 16 National Championships during her racing career, the most of any one person at that time. She stopped competing in 2003 after conceiving her first son shortly after the NBL Grand Nationals.
In late 2009, Melanie returned to racing with her five-year-old son joining her. She and her son have quickly become two riders to watch out for during the 2010 NBL season.

Not that she wanted not to race the boys, but she wanted to retain female involvement in BMX racing. This is in keeping with her penchant to be pro active. She was on the drama club, active in all sports activities in school and carried a 3.8 Grade Point Average (GPA).

=== Significant injuries ===
Broke finger in early 1984 just before the NBL national season at eight years old. she raced anyway despite having to wear a cast that reached up to her elbow for four weeks.
