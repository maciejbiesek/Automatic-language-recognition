Lake Gnangara is the most southerly of the Wanneroo wetlands in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. The state government's Wetland Atlas defines the body of water as a lake. The surrounding terrain is low dunes and undulating sand plains. The lake is fed by ground water of the Gnangara Mound which is contained by a thin layer of clay.

Previous uses have included diatomaceous earth mining, which may have contributed to changes in the lake's characteristics and ecology. The area is now the subject of a conservation plan and management strategies, and protected from potential disturbance by mining activities.
The Lake reserve is an important part of the management of the mound.
