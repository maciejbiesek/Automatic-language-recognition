The Games Academy is the oldest German and European school dedicated to the development of video games. Besides QANTM and Supinfogame, it is one of the few institutions in Europe that are entirely focused on video game development.

== About the Games Academy ==
The Games Academy is a privately held vocational school, founded in 2000 by Thomas Dlugaiczyk in Berlin. In 2007, a second establishment was opened in Frankfurt am Main.
The Games Academy's aim is to offer students an education specialized in the video game business and/or development. Along with the Qantm Institute, the Games Academy is the only educational institution in Germany that is dedicated to such an education.
Most of the school's teachers work in the game industry. The Games Academy is often present at German video game conferences and exhibitions, such as the gamescom or the Making Games-conference.
The Games Academy is cooperating with the FH Braunschweig/Wolfenbttel and the HBK Braunschweig in order to make it possible for students to obtain a recognized academic degree, a Bachelor's degree either in Media & computer science or graphic design.
In 2010, a third location was opened in Vancouver, Canada.
