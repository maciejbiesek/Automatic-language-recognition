== Environmental considerations ==
In June, 2007, LSI was granted Gold Level certification by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for its participation in the Clean Texas program. To obtain material for the construction of SH 130, LSI negotiated to recycle the asphalt runways at the retired Mueller Airport in Austin, Texas, reducing the amount of virgin material needed for the project by over 250,000 tons and reducing the amount of material sent to a landfill. In addition, LSI installed numerous bat boxes beneath the decks of the new SH 130 bridges to support Mexican free-tailed bat colonies.
