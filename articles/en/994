The Hilton Milwaukee City Center hotel is located in the Westown neighborhood of downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and is owned by the Marcus Corporation, which also owns the Pfister Hotel and InterContinental Milwaukee in the area.
It was built in 1927 as the "Schroeder Hotel" by hotel magnate Walter Schroeder, in a neo-classical style. It has a height of 275 feet (84 meters), with an antenna extending its total height to 192 meters. The building has 25 floors and 729 rooms. A 12-floor addition designed by Kahler Slater Architects and built by Mortenson was constructed in 2000.
The Schroeder Hotel was sold to Sheraton Hotels in 1965 and renamed the "Sheraton-Schroeder Hotel". Sheraton sold the hotel in 1972 to local businessman Ben Marcus, who renamed it the "Marc Plaza Hotel". In 1995, when Marcus brought in Hilton Hotels to manage the property, it was renamed the "Hilton Milwaukee City Center".
Hilton Milwaukee City Center is a member of Historic Hotels of America, an official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
