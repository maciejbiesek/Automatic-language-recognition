== History ==
Due to the creation of the parish of Tr, in 1997, Querena was reduced in its geographic extent.

== Geography ==

Situated on a hilltop, that provides the parish with its name, the parish is in the transitional area between the Barrocal and the mountains. Many of the parishes' homes descend these slopes, in many directions.
The caverns of Salustreira, with a length of 80 metres (260 ft) and 8 metres (26 ft) height, are located alongside the Fonte da Benmola, a protected area, an important point of visit to the parish. Fonte da Benmola covers an area of 392 hectares, intersected by the Ribeira de Menalva, an affluent that maintains 60% of its flow throughout the year.
