The 1765 English cricket season gave an indication of increased cricket activity in the north of England as Leeds played Sheffield.
Few major cricket matches were reported in 1765 but events at the Artillery Ground in August may have been almost the last straw where this infamous old venue was concerned.

There was a "threes" game on Friday 30 August at Moulsey Hurst in which Surrey beat Kent "after a smart contest". The source is the Gazetteer & London Daily Advertiser on Wed 4 September.
A notice in the Salisbury Journal on Monday 16 September might have interested the members of the Hambledon Club: The Cricket players of the parish of Portsea (in Hampshire) will play the game of Cricket with any parish in the said County for 20 guineas each match, home and home (sic). It is not known if the challenge was taken up.
