The Saint Thomas d'Aquin sports club was founded in 1903 and its basketball division opened in 1924 by brothers Louis and Roger Pineau. STB Le Havre was the first team to register with the French Basketball Federation when it was established 1932.
In 1952, under coach Edouard Barq, Le Havre qualified for the top league and finished its debut season with a winning record (9-8). In 1955, Claude Josephau carried Le Havre all the way to the French Cup semifinals where the club lost to Paris University Club, 55-50, in front of a crowd of 1,200.
In the late 1980s, Le Havre battled its way back up the ladder and in 1993 secured a spot in the LNB Pro B division of the Ligue Nationale de Basket (LNB). In 1995, the club made the semifinals of the French Cup. The team joined the French Pro A League in 2000. Despite hiring former France national team coach Michel Gomez for the first season in Pro A, the team struggled mightily and fired Gomez to avoid relegation.
