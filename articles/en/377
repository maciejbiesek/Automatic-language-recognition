Glaucippe (), in Greek mythology, is a name that may refer to:
Glaucippe, one of the Danaids, daughter of Danaus and Polyxo. She married (and murdered) Potamon, son of Aegyptus and Caliadne. This Glaucippe is also mentioned by Hyginus. Due to his list of Danaids and Aegyptiads being poorly preserved, her husband's name is almost illegible here: *Niavius.
Glaucippe, daughter of Xanthus and possible mother of Hecuba.
