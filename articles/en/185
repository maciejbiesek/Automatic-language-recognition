Lu Guimeng (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: L Gumng; WadeGiles: Lu Kui-meng; died 881), courtesy name Luwang (), was a recluse Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty. He lived in seclusion at Puli near Suzhou. His pseudonyms included Mr. Puli (), Tiansuizhi (), and Jianghu Shanren ().
He and his friend, the fellow poet Pi Rixiu, created a new style of matching rhyme poetry. One of them would compose a poem, and the other would then reply with a new poem using the same rhyme. His works included:
Songlin Ji (), a collection of matching rhyme poems by Lu and Pi Rixiu
Puli Ji (), Collection of Puli
The Classic of the Plough, a book that described in detail the curved iron plough
