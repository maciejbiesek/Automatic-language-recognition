Pakistan Horticulture Development and Export Company is a department of Ministry of Commerce of Pakistan. Pakistan Horticulture Development and Export Company was created due to the enormous potential of Pakistans horticulture products in the global market. In the absence of a single ministry or institution responsible for development at all levels of the horticulture value chain it was considered important to set up PHDEC to uplift this sector, especially in light of the impact of globalization and WTO regime.
Pakistan Horticulture Development & Export Board (PHDEC), an autonomous body under the administrative control of Ministry of Commerce has been mandated with the development of horticulture industry of Pakistan with focus on exports. Its functions, inter alia, include provision of improved marketing infrastructure like establishment of agro processing zones, cold chain system, processing plants (for value added products) etc. The implementation arrangements are preferably under the public private partnership (PPP) modality with a clear exit strategy. PHDEC envisions the vitalization of a dynamic and market driven horticulture sector, which is resilient, sustainable and responsive to meet the challenges of globalization.
