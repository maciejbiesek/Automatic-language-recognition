Kadavil Malika is a historic place in India, associated with the origin of the Maramon Convention. It is a house in Kallissery and was built by Unnittan Kathanar (1767 - 1852) and his son Abraham Kathanar (1822 - 1884) also known as Kadavil Achen, in the early 19th century.
By 1877, there were two factions in the Malankara Church, known as Methran Kakshi and Bava Kakshi. By a court verdict on 12 July 1889, Methran Kakshi lost all the properties. Just before the verdict was given,on 5 September 1888, 12 members of the Methran Kakshi formed a missionary group called "Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association." They met at Kadavil Malika, the house of Chempakassseril Kadavil Mathuchen (1860 - 1897) and Chempakasseril Kadavil Abraham (sons of Abraham Kathanar and grandsons of Unnithan Kathanar).
These 12 members are considered to be the founding fathers of the Maramon convention. The names of these 12 members are:-
Kottarathil Thomas Kasseessa, Chengannur
Edavamvelil Mathai, Eraviperoor.
Kottooreth Yohannan, Chengannur
