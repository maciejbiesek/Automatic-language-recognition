Buddleja colvilei 'Kewensis' is a cultivar cloned from a plant which once grew in the Temperate House at Kew Gardens, and was introduced to commerce in the UK in 1849. 'Kewensis' was accorded the RHS Award of Merit in 1947.

== Description ==
'Kewensis' is identical to the species in all but its flower colour, which is blood red.

== Cultivation ==
The cultivar is considered marginally hardier than the type, but still demands protection from winter winds, and requires a free-draining soil. Hardiness: USDA zones 78.
