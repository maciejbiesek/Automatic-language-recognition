In enzymology, a 4-galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminide 3-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.152) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
GDP-beta-L-fucose + 1,4-beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R  GDP + 1,4-beta-D-galactosyl-(alpha-1,3-L-fucosyl)-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl- R
Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP-beta-L-fucose and 1,4-beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R. Its 3 products are GDP, 1,4-beta-D-galactosyl-(alpha-1,3-L-fucosyl)-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-, and R.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-beta-L-fucose:1,4-beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R 3-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include:
Lewis-negative alpha-3-fucosyltransferase
plasma alpha-3-fucosyltransferase
guanosine diphosphofucose-glucoside alpha13-fucosyltransferase
galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase
GDP-L-fucose:1,4-beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R
3-L-fucosyltransferase
GDP-beta-L-fucose:1,4-beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R, and
3-L-fucosyltransferase
This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - neo-lactoseries, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - globoseries, and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2.

== Structural studies ==
As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes 2NZW, 2NZX, and 2NZY.
