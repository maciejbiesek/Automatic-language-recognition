== Plot summary ==
Tired of always running from the law, Fuzzy leaves his pals Billy and Jeff and heads to Paradise Valley to be a homesteader. However when he finds himself in trouble, he sends for them. Angry at Fuzzy for abandoning them, Billy and Jeff decide to put on the ruse of helping Fuzzy while actually going behind his back to extract their vengeance. They take out an insurance policy on Fuzzy through a shifty Jewish banker named Ishmael. They find the source of Fuzzy's trouble, Matt Brawley, who controls the town and is running a land swindle.
When an outlaw gang led by Jack Saunders arrives and threatens the pair's insurance fraud scheme, Billy has a plan to take them out of the picture, while also making it look like an "accident." Brawley and his men fall victim to hyperhidrosis and die painfully.
