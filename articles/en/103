== Career ==

Born Enrico Sbriccoli in Camerino, Italy, he went to Rome, after graduating from school, to study Economics and Accounting, while teaching himself the bass and attending local jazz venues. Eventually, he would devote himself completely to music. Early on in his career, he adopted the stage name Jimmy Fontana, taking the name of one of his idols, American musician Jimmy Giuffre, and the surname "Fontana" arbitrarily, as he related, out of the phone book.
He started his own jazz band, Fontana and his Trio, with piano, bass and drums, and around that time he met Leda, who would become his wife and with whom they would have four children, Luigi, Roberto, Andrea and Paola.
At the end of the 1950s, he turned to light music and began his solo career. His first success was "Diavolo" ("Devil") that won him third place in the Festival of Barcelona. With his song "Bevo" ("Drink"), in 1960, he won the Burlamacco Gold, a music competition in Viareggio. His first participation in the Festival of Sanremo came in 1961 with "Lady luna" ("Lady moon"), written by Armando Trovajoli and Dino Verde. His first single with RCA is "Non te ne andare" ("Don't go"), released in 1963 and written by Gianni Meccia and Lilli Greek.
In 1965, Fontana had his major success with "Il mondo" ("The world"), a song composed by Fontana and Carlo Pes, and arranged by Ennio Morricone, with lyrics by Gianni Meccia, which reached the top of the charts in Italy and other countries in Europe and charted in Latin America as well. The same year, he made his debut as an actor, appearing in two musicarelli, which are movies heavily featuring musical numbers, titled Viale della canzone ("Avenue of song") and 008 Operazione ritmo ("008 Operation rhythm").
Jimmy Fontana's hits include "La mia serenata" that won the Disco per l'estate Festival in 1967.
At the 1968 Cantagiro summer festival, Fontana sang a cover version of the Tom Jones hit "Delilah", titled "La nostra favola." The song reached 2nd place in the Italian hit parade.
In 1971, the song "Che sar" ("What will it be?"), composed by Fontana with lyrics by Franco Migliacci, was performed by Jos Feliciano with the Ricchi e Poveri group at that year's Sanremo Music Festival, winning 2nd prize. It eventually became one of the biggest pop music hits of the era in Italy and abroad.
Jimmy Fontana continued appearing on TV shows and touring around Italy and abroad until his old age. He died peacefully at his home in Rome, a few days before his 79th birthday, while still planning concert tours.
