The Park Building is an historic building in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA. Built in 1914, the eleven story structure was for many years one of Worcester's most prominent landmarks. It has a steel frame, with an exterior that is dressed predominantly in limestone. The first two floors have metal and plate glass store fronts, while the third floor has evenly spaced windows, separated by decorative limestone panels and topped by a cornice. From the fourth to the ninth floors there is little decoration. The top two floors have groups of windows separated by Tuscan columns, giving the appearance of a loggia.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is currently tied as the 11th tallest building in Worcester.
