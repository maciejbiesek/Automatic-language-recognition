Hareby is a small village in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated 4 miles (6 km) west from the town of Spilsby. A former civil parish, Hareby is now in the parish of Bolingbroke.

The village is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book. Hareby is now considered a deserted medieval village, and earthworks can be seen south from the church.
The parish church sits on Hareby Hill and is dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul; it is a Grade II listed building of greenstone and red brick. The present church dates from 1858, although it reuses details dating from the 14th century. The font dates from the 17th century.
The Millennium Dome near the church is a small gazebo with views from Hareby Hill.
